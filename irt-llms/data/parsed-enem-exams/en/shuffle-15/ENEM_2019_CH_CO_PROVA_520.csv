QUESTION 46,"Pure hospitality consists of welcoming those who arrive before imposing conditions, before knowing and asking anything, even if it's a name or an identity document. But it also means addressing them in a unique way, calling them by their first name and recognizing them: ""What's your name?"" Hospitality consists of doing everything you can to address the other person, to grant them permission, even to ask their name, preventing this question from becoming a ""condition"", a police inquiry, a file or a simple border control.

QUESTION 47,"In a general and fundamental sense, Law is the technique of human coexistence, that is, the technique aimed at making it possible for men to coexist. As a technique, Law is concretized in a set of rules (which, in this case, are laws or norms); and these rules have intersubjective behavior as their object, that is, the reciprocal behavior of men among themselves. The general and fundamental meaning of Law, as has been pointed out, refers to the",legitimizing political decisions.,mediation of economic conflicts.,regulating social interaction.,representation of the constituted authority.,application of legal codes.,2019,47,CH,C,english,"['C', 'D', 'B', 'E', 'A']"
QUESTION 48,"The processing of manioc was an activity already carried out by the natives who lived in Brazil before the arrival of the Portuguese and Africans. However, throughout the process of Portuguese colonization, the production of flour was perfected and expanded, becoming commonplace throughout the territory of the Portuguese colony in America. With the consolidation of Atlantic trade in its various connections, flour crossed the seas and reached African markets. Considering the formation of the Atlantic space, this product historically exemplifies the",appropriation of warrior customs.,expanding indigenous knowledge.,spread of eating habits.,diversification of religious offerings.,dissemination of festive rituals.,2019,48,CH,C,english,"['D', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'B']"
QUESTION 49,"Brazil, Germany, Japan and India call for Security Council reform In September 2018, the representatives of the G4 (Brazil, Germany, India and Japan) reiterated their call for the expansion of the United Nations Security Council during a meeting in New York (United States). In a ten-item joint statement, the foreign ministers stressed that the body as it stands, with only five permanent and ten rotating members, does not reflect the 21st century. ""Security Council reform is essential to meet today's complex challenges. As aspirants for new permanent members of a reformed council, the ministers reiterated their commitment to working to strengthen the functioning of the UN and the global multilateral order, as well as their support for their respective candidacies,"" says the joint statement.

QUESTION 50,"It was now a question of building a new rhythm. To do so, it was necessary to summon all the living forces of the nation, all the men who, with the will to work and confidence in the future, could build a new era. And to the great call that summoned the people to the gigantic task, the workers began to arrive from all corners of the immense homeland: the simple, quiet men, with feet made of roots, faces made of leather and hands made of stone, and on their heels, in ox carts, on donkey backs, on sticks, in every way possible and imaginable, in their hope-filled silence, often leaving behind wives and children to await their promises of better days; they arrived from so many villages, so many towns whose names seemed to sing nostalgia in their ears, within the ancient rhythms of the immense homeland... Land of sun, land of light... Brazil! Brazil! Brasília! (Vinicius de Moraes and Antônio Carlos Jobim) In the text, the narrative produced about the construction of Brasilia articulates the political and socio-economic elements indicated in, respectively:",Territorial security and financial stability.,Democratic perspective and transport efficiency.,Trade union organization and the expansion of capital.,Symbolic appeal and interregional migration.,Party consensus and road modernization.,2019,50,CH,D,english,"['C', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 51,"Greeted by hundreds of social movement activists from forty countries, Pope Francis closed the Second World Meeting of Popular Movements in Santa Cruz de La Sierra, Bolivia, on July 9, 2015. According to him, the ""globalization of hope, which is born of the peoples and grows among the poor, must replace this globalization of exclusion and indifference"". The text criticizes the following aspects of the globalized world:",Commercial complementarity.,Economic disparity.,Human mobility.,Cultural connectivity.,Political freedom.,2019,51,CH,B,english,"['E', 'D', 'B', 'C', 'A']"
QUESTION 52,"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted and proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 217-A of December 10, 1948, was a major historical event. By affirming, for the first time on a global scale, the role of human rights in collective coexistence, it can be considered the inaugural event of a new conception of international life. The declaration mentioned in the text introduced a new concept in international relations by making it possible to",impunity for criminal acts.,inhibiting civilizational clashes.,reduction of warmongering truculence.,defense of vulnerable groups.,overcoming state sovereignty.,2019,52,CH,D,english,"['D', 'E', 'C', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 53,"Image description: On one wall there are two photos showing people belonging to indigenous communities. The photos are framed with arabesques drawn around each of them. In the center, between the framed photos, next to an engraving of the bust of a woman speaking, is written: ""NUESTRA CULTURA NO CABE EN SUS MUSEOS"". Translation of the text in Spanish: ""Our culture doesn't fit in your museums"". Produced in Chile at the end of the 1970s, the image expresses a conflict between cultures and their presence in museums as a result of the",fragmentation of the territories of the communities represented.,appreciation of the art market.,defining the criteria for creating collections.,expanding the network of memory institutions.,bureaucratization of access to exhibition spaces.,2019,53,CH,C,english,"['E', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D']"

QUESTION 55,"The medieval city is first and foremost a society of abundance, concentrated in a small space in the midst of vast, sparsely populated regions. Next, it is a place of production and exchange, where crafts and commerce come together, supported by a monetary economy. It is also the center of a particular value system, from which emerges the laborious and creative practice of work, a taste for business and money, a penchant for luxury and a sense of beauty. It is also a system for organizing an enclosed space with walls, where you enter through gates and walk through streets and squares, and which is guarded by towers. In the text, the space described is characterized by the association between the expansion of urban activities and the",acceptance of the usury practices of the religious.,independence of rural food production.,permanence of the protective architectural elements.,overcoming the corporative order of the trades.,emancipation from the hegemonic power of royalty.,2019,55,CH,C,english,"['B', 'C', 'E', 'D', 'A']"

TEXT II Ecotourism is not only about bathing in waterfalls, sitting and walking along the beach, horseback riding, but also about getting to know biodiversity, which is sometimes supposedly endangered. Watching whales, swimming with dolphins, touching coral, meeting dozens of alligators in their natural habitat are all symbols that fascinate ecotourists. Nature is transformed into a spectacle different from modern urban life. The texts respectively identify the following attitudes towards nature:",Sacralization and desecration.,Idealization and commodification.,Preservation and degradation.,Exploitation and romanticization.,Segregation and democratization.,2019,56,CH,B,english,"['B', 'E', 'C', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 57,"Most of the aggressions and discriminatory manifestations against religions of African origin take place in public places (57 percent). More than two thirds of the attacks took place in the street, generally in places close to the houses of worship of these religions. Public transport is also mentioned as a place where adherents of religions of African origin are discriminated against, usually when they are dressed up because of their religious precepts. The practices described in the text are incompatible with the dynamics of a secular and democratic society because",distort theological dogmas.,encourage syncretic rituals.,restrict freedom of belief.,promote ethnic diversity.,ensure multicultural expressions.,2019,57,CH,C,english,"['C', 'D', 'E', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 58,"TEXT I Economic centralization, protectionism and overseas expansion aggrandized the state, although they benefited the incipient bourgeoisie. TEXT II The interference of legislation and exclusivist practices restricted the beneficial operation of natural law in the sphere of economic relations. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, different conceptions of the relationship between the state and the economy were formulated. These conceptions, associated with each of the texts, clash, respectively, in the opposition between the practices of",formation of the metropolitan system - criticism of free navigation.,valuing the colonial pact - fighting free enterprise.,abandoning metal accumulation - encouraging free trade.,defense of royal monopolies - support for free competition.,elimination of customs tariffs - encouraging free trade.,2019,58,CH,D,english,"['C', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 59,"Legend has it that on a beautiful sunny day, Newton was relaxing under an apple tree. Birds were twittering in his ears. There was a gentle breeze.  He dozed for a few minutes. Suddenly, an apple fell on his head and he woke up with a start. He looked up. ""Surely a bird or a squirrel knocked the apple out of the tree,"" he assumed. But there were no birds or squirrels in the tree nearby.  He then thought: ""Just a few minutes before, the apple was hanging from the tree. No external force caused it to fall. There must be some underlying force that causes things to fall to earth."" As opposed to an idealized interpretation, the text points to the following fundamental dimension of modern science:",Universalization of conclusions.,Proposing hypotheses.,Denial of observation.,Contemplation of nature.,Falsification of theses.,2019,59,CH,B,english,"['E', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'A']"
QUESTION 60,"Hardly a night goes by without some farmer having his barn or pile of grain destroyed by fire. Several workers not directly involved in the attacks seemed to support them, as can be seen in this statement to The Times: ""let it burn, pity it wasn't the house""; ""we can get warm now""; ""we just wanted some potatoes, there's a great fire to cook them on"".

QUESTION 61,"Among the combatants was the most famous heroine of Independence. Born in Feira de Santana, the daughter of poor farmers, Maria Quitéria de Jesus was thirty years old when Bahia took up arms against the Portuguese. Despite the ban on women in volunteer battalions, she decided to enlist on the sly. She cut her hair, tied up her breasts, dressed as a man and joined the Brazilian ranks under the name Soldado Medeiros. In the process of Brazilian Independence, the case mentioned is emblematic because it shows the",administrative flexibility of the imperial government.,hierarchical rigidity of the social structure.,public support for Portuguese immigrants.,the inclusion of women in the military trades.,metropolitan receptivity to emancipatory ideals.,2019,61,CH,B,english,"['D', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 62,"The global restructuring of industry, conditioned by the global management strategies of the value chain of the large transnational groups, promoted a strong shift in the production process, even of entire industrial plants, and redirected production and investment flows. However, the increase in the share of developing countries in global output was quite asymmetrical when comparing the dynamism of East Asian countries with that of other countries, especially Latin American countries, in the period 1980-2000. The dynamics of the transformation of the geography of industries described exposes the complementarity between spatial dispersion and",technological autonomy.,supply crises.,political decentralization.,economic concentration.,profit sharing.,2019,62,CH,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 63,"Image description: Representation of a map entitled ""Arid and semi-arid regions of the world"". In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a marked incidence of arid (desert) regions, with semi-arid surroundings in each of them, in the east of the United States and Mexico, in northern Africa and southern Europe and in much of Asia (all at the height of the Tropic of Cancer line). In the Southern Hemisphere, there are arid (desert) regions, with semi-arid surroundings in each of them, in the Andes Mountains (at the Tropic of Capricorn line), in southwest Africa and in central Australia. In Brazil, between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, there is only the incidence of a semi-arid region, without the incidence of an arid region (desert). In the Southern Hemisphere, the latitudinal sequence of deserts represented in the image is interrupted in Brazil for the following reason:",Intense reflective surfaces.,Absence of continental air masses.,High atmospheric pressures prevail.,Influence of humidity in forest areas.,Cold sea currents predominate.,2019,63,CH,D,english,"['A', 'E', 'B', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 64,"In fact, it is not because man can use his free will to sin that it should be assumed that God gave it to him to do so. There is, therefore, a reason why God gave man this characteristic, because without it he would not be able to live and act correctly. It can be understood, then, that it was given to man for this purpose, considering that if a man uses it to sin, divine punishments will fall on him. Now, this would be unjust if the free will had been given to man not only to act correctly, but also to sin. In fact, why should those who use their will for the purpose for which it was given be punished? In this text, the Christian philosopher Augustine of Hippo argues that divine punishment is based on",insufficiency of moral autonomy.,deviation from the celibate posture.,violation of the precepts of the Old Testament.,distancing themselves from sacrificial practices.,moving away from detachment actions.,2019,64,CH,A,english,"['B', 'A', 'E', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 65,"Located 160 km from the city of Porto Velho (capital of the state of Rondônia), on the edge of the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve and the Karipunas Indigenous Land, the village of União Bandeirantes emerged in 2000 from movements of peasants, loggers, cattle ranchers and land grabbers who, in defiance of territorial planning and in the face of government passivity, demarcated and invaded land in the rural area, founding the village. Today, it is the region with the highest agricultural and dairy production in the municipality of Porto Velho, even supplying food for the Jirau hydroelectric plant. The dynamics of territorial occupation described were the result of the",expansion of pioneer fronts.,expansion of urban bangs.,adoption of directed colonization.,mechanization of the production process.,land reform.,2019,65,CH,A,english,"['E', 'D', 'B', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 66,"At no other time has the thin body acquired a sense of the ideal body and been in the spotlight as much as it is today: this body, naked or clothed, displayed in various women's and men's magazines, is fashionable: it's on the cover of magazines, in newspapers, in advertising headlines, and has become a consumer dream for thousands of people. Based on this conception, the fat person has a visibly unhealthy body, a body stigmatized by deviance, deviance by excess. However, as writer Marylin Wann says, it is perfectly possible to be fat and healthy. Fat people often fall ill not because they are fat, but because of the stress and oppression they are subjected to. In the text, the media's predominant treatment of the relationship between health and the body is criticized as follows:",Exaltation of popular beliefs.,Challenging consolidated stereotypes.,Propagation of scientific conclusions.,Reiteration of hegemonic discourses.,Diffusion of ancient aesthetics.,2019,66,CH,B,english,"['B', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'A']"
QUESTION 67,"In the capitalist system, the many manifestations of crisis create conditions that force some kind of rationalization. In general, these periodic crises have the effect of expanding productive capacity and renewing the conditions of accumulation. We can conceive of each crisis as a shift in the accumulation process to a new and higher level. The condition for the inclusion of workers in the new production process described in the text is the",international migration.,electoral participation.,professional qualification.,union association.,functional regulation.,2019,67,CH,C,english,"['C', 'B', 'D', 'A', 'E']"

QUESTION 69,"Image description: Photograph of a well-maintained cobbled street. At the end of the cobblestones and the curb is a small garden, with the word ""veracity"" on the side. In the background is a wall with various graffiti. We are talking here about art created on the streets and for the streets, marked above all by everyday life, its conflicts and its possibilities, which could involve techniques, agents and themes that are not found in more traditional and formal institutions. The artistic manifestation expressed in the image and presented in the text is part of a contemporary movement of",revitalization of historical heritage.,appropriation of public spaces.,appreciation of aesthetic formalisms.,standardization of urban cultures.,regulating social relations.,2019,69,CH,B,english,"['E', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'A']"

TEXT II - Kant (reread) , by Orides Fontela Two things I admire: the harsh law covering me and the starry sky within me. The rereading carried out by the poet inverts the following central ideas of Kantian thought:",Priority of judgment and importance of nature.,The interiority of the norm and the phenomenality of the world.,Possibility of freedom and obligation of action.,The indispensability of the empirical and the authority of reason.,The need for good will and the critique of metaphysics.,2019,70,CH,B,english,"['B', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 71,"The sovereignty of citizens with full rights was essential for the existence of the city-state. Depending on the political regime, the proportion of these citizens in relation to the total population of free men could vary greatly, being quite small in aristocracies and oligarchies and larger in democracies. In the city-states of Classical Antiquity, the proportion of citizens described in the text is explained by the adoption of the following criteria for political participation:",Ground control.,Freedom of worship.,Exclusion of the military.,Gender equality.,Literacy requirement.,2019,71,CH,A,english,"['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 72,"The Vaccine Revolt (1904) clearly showed the defensive, disorganized and fragmented aspect of popular action. They didn't deny the state, they didn't demand participation in political decisions; they defended values and rights considered to be above state intervention. The mobilization analyzed represented a wake-up call, in that the popular action questioned",urban reforms.,clientelist policy.,the rise in prices.,electoral practices.,government discretion.,2019,72,CH,E,english,"['C', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 73,"From the second half of the 18th century, the number of newly arrived slaves grew in Rio and stabilized in Bahia. No place was better at receiving slaves than Rio de Janeiro.

Thanks to the complicity of Queen Elizabeth I, he returns and plunders the coasts of Chile and Peru before returning via the Pacific Ocean and then the Indian Ocean. In Ternate, he offered his protection to a sultan in revolt with the Portuguese, thus creating the first English overseas trading post. The tactic adopted by 16th century England, as mentioned in the text, was the means found to",strengthen maritime trade routes.,conquer the riches of the American territories.,legalizing the occupation of Iberian possessions.,re-establish the growth of the mercantile economy.,gain the support of the European powers.,2019,74,CH,B,english,"['E', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 75,"The Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE) carried out 248 inspections and rescued a total of 1,590 workers from slave-like conditions throughout the country in 2014. The analysis of the fight against work in conditions analogous to slavery shows the implementation of unprecedented partnerships in dealing with the issue, with reference to tax actions carried out with the Ministry of Defense, the Brazilian Army, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The strategy advocated in the text to reduce the social problem pointed out consists of:",Limiting the autonomy of companies.,Articulate with public bodies.,Put pressure on the legislative branch.,Funding academic research.,Expand the issuing of fines.,2019,75,CH,B,english,"['D', 'A', 'B', 'E', 'C']"
QUESTION 76,"The demographic bonus is characterized by the period in which, due to the reduction in the number of children per woman, the population structure becomes favorable to economic growth. This is because there are proportionally fewer children in the population, and the percentage of elderly people is not yet high. The state action that contributes to taking advantage of the demographic bonus is the stimulus to",increase in the tax burden.,attracting immigrants.,qualification of the workforce.,admission of political exiles.,granting of pensions.,2019,76,CH,C,english,"['B', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 77,"The residents of Utqiagvik spent two months almost entirely in darkness The inhabitants of this small town in Alaska - the northernmost US state - are used to long nights without seeing daylight. On November 18, 2018, its little more than 4,000 inhabitants saw the last sunset of the year.  The next opportunity to see daylight occurred on January 23, 2019, at 13 h 04 min (local time). The phenomenon described is related to the fact that the town in question has a geographical position conditioned by the",marital status.,altitude.,longitude.,latitude.,continentality.,2019,77,CH,D,english,"['B', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'A']"
QUESTION 78,"Hunger is not a technical problem, as it is not due to a lack of food, because hunger today coexists with the material conditions to solve it.

QUESTION 79,"The giant ecological footprint we are leaving on the planet is transforming it to such an extent that experts believe we have already entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. And many argue that if we don't stop the environmental crisis, we'll turn Earth into Venus faster than we'll go to Mars. The term ""Anthropocene"" is attributed to chemist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen, who proposed it during a conference in 2000, at the same time as announcing the end of the Holocene - the geological epoch in which human beings have been around for around 12,000 years, according to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), the body that defines geological time units.

QUESTION 81,"It is said that Humboldt, a 19th century naturalist who marveled at the geography, flora and fauna of the South American region, saw its inhabitants as if they were beggars sitting on a sack of gold, referring to its immeasurable untapped natural wealth. In a way, the scientist ratified our role as exporters of nature in what would become the world after Iberian colonization: he saw us as territories condemned to take advantage of existing natural resources. The relationship between human beings and nature highlighted in the text reflected the permanence of the following philosophical current:",Cartesian rationalism.,Epistemological pluralism.,Phenomenological existentialism.,Dialectical materialism.,Cognitive relativism.,2019,81,CH,A,english,"['C', 'D', 'E', 'B', 'A']"

The studies on neonicotinoid insecticides should be completed in the first half of 2015. This is a problem on a global scale, present even in so-called first world countries, which as a consequence poses a serious threat to living beings on the planet, including humans. What solution to this problem will guarantee the productivity of modern agriculture?",Expansion of the tropical monoculture model.,Adoption of chemical fertilization.,Use of biological control techniques.,Preservation of the riparian forest area.,Intensification of floodplain soil drainage.,2019,82,CH,C,english,"['D', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'E']"
QUESTION 83,"Christianity incorporated ancient practices relating to fire to create a syncretic festival. The church took up the six-month gap between the births of Jesus Christ and John the Baptist and set the date to commemorate the latter in such a way that the European summer solstice festivities with their traditional bonfires became ""St. John's bonfires"". However, the feast of fire and light was not immediately associated with St. John the Baptist. In the Lower Middle Ages, some traditional practices of the feast (such as bathing, dancing and singing) were persecuted by monks and bishops. From the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the Church decided to adopt celebrations around fire and associate them with Christian doctrine. In order to strengthen itself, the institution mentioned in the text adopted the practices described, which consist of",appropriation of secular ceremonies.,reframing fundamentalist rituals.,taking up apostolic teachings.,promoting ecumenical events.,promoting biblical guidance.,2019,83,CH,A,english,"['C', 'E', 'D', 'A', 'B']"
QUESTION 84,"I don't think there is a sovereign, founding subject, a universal form of subject that we could find everywhere. I think, on the contrary, that the subject is constituted through practices of subjection or, in a more autonomous way, through practices of liberation, of freedom, as in Antiquity - based, of course, on a certain number of rules, styles, that we can find in the cultural milieu. (Michel Foucault) Michel Foucault's text points out that subjectivation takes place in a dimension","essential, based on substantialist parameters.","contingency, processed in social interactions.","transcendental, based on religious principles.","rational, based on logical assumptions.","legal, based on legal precepts.",2019,84,CH,B,english,"['E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 85,"TEXT I - Francis Bacon's Novum Organum The secrets of nature are revealed more under the torture of experiments than in their natural course. TEXT II Human beings, totally disintegrated from the whole, no longer perceive the relationships of balance in nature.  He acts in a totally inharmonious way on the environment, causing major environmental imbalances.

QUESTION 86,"Origins of totalitarianism, Hanna Arendt This atmosphere of madness and unreality, created by the apparent absence of purpose, is the real iron curtain that hides all forms of concentration camps from the eyes of the world. Seen from the outside, the camps and what happens in them can only be described with extraterrestrial images, as if life in them were separate from the purposes of this world. More than the barbed wire, it is the unreality of the inmates it confines that causes such incredible cruelty that it ends up leading to the acceptance of extermination as a perfectly normal solution. From the author's analysis, in the meeting of historical temporalities, we can see a criticism of the naturalization of the","human segregation, which underpins biopolitical projects.","national ideology, which legitimizes social inequalities.","religious cosmology, which underpins hierarchical traditions.","cultural framework, which favors punitive behavior.","ideological alienation, which justifies individual actions.",2019,86,CH,A,english,"['D', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'B']"
QUESTION 87,"For Machiavelli, when a man decides to tell the truth at the risk of his own physical integrity, such a decision only concerns him. But if that same man is a head of state, personal criteria are no longer adequate to decide on actions whose consequences become so far-reaching, since the damage will not only be individual, but collective. In this case, depending on the circumstances and the ends to be achieved, it may be decided that the best thing for the common good is to lie.
