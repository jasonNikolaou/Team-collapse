A mulher, que está retirando um livro de uma estante alta e repleta de livros, comenta: “I suppose it’s my library too, now we’re married”. No terceiro quadrinho, o homem ergue o dedo indicador e diz: “The forest is crawling with ravenous wolves, malignant birds and the spirits of long-dead travellers.”. A mulher passa por ele carregando três livros e exclama: “So many books! I can’t believe my luck!”. No último quadrinho, o homem, que está transformado em um ser com asas e patas e voando em direção contrária à da mulher, fala: “When the sun sets, I transform into a wild beast and soar into the night, seized by a terrible bloodlust!”.

QUESTION 02,"A Teen’s View of Social Media Instagram is made up of all photos and videos. There is the home page that showcases the posts from people you follow, an explore tab which offers posts from accounts all over the world, and your own page, with a notification tab to show who likes and comments on your posts. It has some downsides though. It is known to make many people feel insecure or down about themselves because the platform showcases the highlights of everyone’s lives, while rarely showing the negatives. This can make one feel like their life is not going as well as others, contributing to the growing rates of anxiety or depression in many teens today. There is an underlying desire for acceptance through the number of likes or followers one has.

QUESTION 04,"Two hundred years ago, Jane Austen lived in a world where single men boasted vast estates; single ladies were expected to speak several languages, sing and play the piano. In both cases, it was, of course, advantageous if you looked good too. So, how much has — or hasn’t — changed? Dating apps opaquely outline the demands of today’s relationship market; users ruminate long and hard over their choice of pictures and what they write in their biographies to hook in potential lovers, and that’s just your own profile. What do you look for in a future partner’s profile — potential signifiers of a popular personality, a good job, a nice car? These apps are a poignant reminder of the often classist attitudes we still adopt, as well as the financial and aesthetic expectations we demand from potential partners. O texto aborda relações interpessoais com o objetivo de ",discutir o uso de aplicativos para proporcionar encontros românticos.,apontar a relevância da educação formal na escolha de parceiros.,comparar a expectativa de parceiros amorosos em épocas distintas.,valorizar a importância da aparência física na seleção de pretendentes.,problematizar o papel de gênero em casamentos modernos.,2022,4,LC,C,english,"['D', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'A']"
QUESTION 05,"As my official bio reads, I was made in Cuba, assembled in Spain, and imported to the United States — meaning my mother, seven months pregnant, and the rest of my family arrived as exiles from Cuba to Madrid, where I was born. Less than two months later, we emigrated once more and settled in New York City, then eventually in Miami, where I was raised and educated. Although technically we lived in the United States, the Cuban community was culturally insular in Miami during the 1970s, bonded together by the trauma of exile. What’s more, it seemed that practically everyone was Cuban: my teachers, my classmates, the mechanic, the bus driver. I didn’t grow up feeling different or treated as a minority. The few kids who got picked on in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny last names like Dawson and O’Neil. Ao relatar suas vivências, o autor destaca o(a) ",fortalecimento do elo familiar em comunidades estadunidenses.,oportunidade de qualificação profissional em Miami.,cenário da integração de cubanos nos Estados Unidos.,prestígio da cultura cubana nos Estados Unidos.,qualidade da educação formal em Miami.,2022,5,LC,C,english,"['E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'A']"

QUESTION 03,"Pequeño hermano Es, no cabe duda, el instrumento más presente y más poderoso de todos los que entraron en nuestras vidas. Ni la televisión ni el ordenador, no hablemos ya del obsoleto fax o de las agendas o los libros electrónicos, ha tenido tal influencia, tal predicamento sobre nosotros. El móvil somos nosotros mismos. Todo desactivado e inerte, inocuo, ya les digo. Y de repente, tras un viaje y tres o cuatro imprudentes fotos, salta un aviso en la pantalla. Con sonido, además, pese a que tengo también todas las alertas desactivadas. Y mi monstruo doméstico me dice: tienes un recuerdo nuevo. Lo repetiré: tienes un recuerdo nuevo. ¿Y tú qué sabes? ¿Y a ti, máquina demoníaca, qué te importa? ¿Cómo te atreves a decirme qué son o no son mis recuerdos? ¿Qué es esta intromisión, este descaro? El pequeño hermano lo sabe casi todo. Sólo hay una esperanza: que la obsolescencia programada mate antes al pequeño hermano y que nosotros sigamos vivos, con los recuerdos que nos dé la gana.

Y me cuenta que cuando vivía en Buenos Aires, en los tiempos del terror, él llevaba cinco llaves ajenas en su llavero: cinco llaves, de cinco casas, de cinco amigos: las llaves que lo salvaron.

QUESTION 06,"Rayssa Leal's silver medal in street skateboarding at the Olympic Games is an example of how representative women are in sport, says the anchor of CNN's news program. The presenter, who also skateboards, celebrated the victory of the Brazilian, who made history as the youngest athlete to stand on a podium defending Brazil. ""This representation of sport at the Games makes us think that we don't have to fit in anywhere. I can be a newscaster and still enjoy skateboarding, mountain climbing, diving, cycling and yoga. We have to stop fitting people into rules. We live by a standard in which girls get dolls, but why not also do adventure sports? Why can a man hurt himself, fall to his knees, and a girl always have to look beautiful within a standard? We end up limiting people's talents,"" said the journalist, about the practice of skateboarding by women.

QUESTION 07,"A trampling, dragnetting, pushing and shoving, aggression, vandalism and even the theft of a fan who was lying on the pavement after being hit by a car in the vicinity of the Maracanã stadium. The scenes of savagery were triggered by the invasion of thousands of fans without tickets, who broke through the police blockade and turned the stadium into a no-man's land. This is a reflection not only of the insecurity that plagues Rio de Janeiro, but also of how social violence is embedded in the country's most popular sport. In 2017, 104 episodes of violence were recorded in Brazilian soccer, resulting in 11 deaths of fans. Since 1995, when 101 fans were injured and one died during a pitched battle at the Pacaembu stadium, authorities have focused their actions to combat soccer violence on uniformed groups, some of which are banned from stadiums. However, a purely repressive stance against organized supporters is ineffective in a society that records more than 61,000 homicides a year. ""It is impossible to dissociate the escalation of violence in soccer from the panorama of public, social, economic and political disorder experienced by the country,"" according to a doctor in the sociology of sport. In this text, soccer violence is characterized as a",social problem located in one region of the country.,challenge for the clubs' organized supporters.,as a result of the clubs' dissatisfaction with the organization of the matches.,a reflection of the precariousness of social organization in the country.,inadequate space in the stadiums to receive the public.,2022,7,LC,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'E', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 08,"Six out of ten people aged 15 or over don't do any sport or physical activity. That's more than 100 million sedentary people. These are data from the study Practices of sport and physical activity, from Pnad 2015, carried out by IBGE. Lack of time and interest are the main reasons given for being sedentary. At the same time, 73.3 percent of people aged 15 and over said that public authorities should invest in sport and physical activity. There was a direct relationship between schooling and income in terms of taking part in sports or physical activities. While 17.3 percent of people who had no schooling carried out various bodily practices, this percentage reached 56.7 percent of people who had completed higher education. Among those who practiced sports and physical activity regularly, the percentage of practitioners ranged from 31.1 percent for those with no income to 65.2 percent for those earning five minimum wages or more. Lack of time was reported more by the adult population, especially among people aged 25 to 39. Among teenagers aged 15 to 17, the main reason was that they didn't like it or didn't want to do it. The main reason for practicing sport, declared by 11.2 million people, was to relax or have fun, followed by improving quality of life or well-being. The lack of accessible or nearby sports facilities was the least cited reason, demonstrating that not practicing would be less associated with the available infrastructure. Based on the survey and a broader view of health, in order for regular exercise to have a significant influence on the health of Brazilians, it is necessary to develop strategies that",combat the sedentary lifestyle that is present in a significant portion of the national population.,help build more sports facilities and adequate spaces for physical activity and sports.,promote the improvement of the population's physical fitness by devoting more time to sports.,"facilitate the adoption of exercise, with actions related to education and income distribution.",encourage tax incentives for the private sector to allocate funds to national programs to promote health through sport.,2022,8,LC,D,english,"['B', 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 09,"Created around 20 years ago in California, mountainboarding is an adventure sport that uses a kind of off-road skateboard to perform maneuvers similar to snowboarding, surfing and skateboarding. The activity arrived in Brazil in 1997 and today it has hundreds of practitioners, a respectable national circuit and more than a dozen tracks throughout the country. According to the official history, mountainboarding was created by snowboarders who missed practicing the sport during periods without snow. To do this, they developed a very simple piece of equipment: a board similar to the model used on snow (smaller and a little less flexible), with two very sturdy axles, handles to fit the feet and four tires with tubes to regulate the speed that can be reached in different conditions. With this configuration, the sport has proved possible on different types of terrain: grass, dirt, stones, asphalt and sand. In addition to these surfaces, it is also possible to look for the trails themselves to practice maneuvers. The history of mountainboarding represents one of the main hallmarks of adventure activities, characterized by the",mode with predetermined rules.,competitiveness among its practitioners.,creativity to adapt to new spaces.,activity with defined technical standards.,the need for defined spaces for their realization.,2022,9,LC,C,english,"['C', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 10,"Being a chronicler Clarice Lispector I know I'm not, but I've been thinking about it. Is a chronicle a story? Is it a conversation? Is it a summary of a state of mind? I don't know, because before I started writing for Jornal do Brasil, I had only written novels and short stories. And without realizing it, as I wrote here, I became too personal, running the risk of soon publishing my past and present life, which I don't intend to do. Another thing I've noticed is that all I have to do is know that I'm writing for the newspaper, i.e. for something that's easily open to the whole world, and not for a book, which is only opened by those who really want to, so that, without even feeling it, the way I write changes. It's not that I don't like change, on the contrary. But I'd like them to be deeper, more internal changes that aren't reflected in my writing. But to change just because it's a column or a chronicle? To be lighter just because the reader wants it that way? To entertain? Make a few minutes of reading pass? And another thing: in my books I want deep communication with myself and the reader. Here at the newspaper, I'm just talking to the reader and I'm pleased that the reader is pleased. I'll tell you the truth: I'm not happy. In the text, when reflecting on the activity of a chronicler, the author questions characteristics of the chronicle genre, such as",detailed description of the characters.,brevity in dealing with the subject.,articulation of several narrative nuclei.,exclusive readership.,distanced relationship between the interlocutors.,2022,10,LC,B,english,"['D', 'C', 'B', 'E', 'A']"
QUESTION 11,"A bill in the Belo Horizonte City Council wants dogs to be vaccinated free of charge against leishmaniasis The disease is serious and has been causing concern in the metropolitan region of the capital of Minas Gerais It is a serious disease, transmitted by the bite of the straw mosquito, and it affects both humans and dogs: leishmaniasis. Because it is a public health problem, the disease could gain important preventive action if a bill is approved by the Belo Horizonte City Council (CMBH). In view of the high number of cases of the disease in Greater Belo Horizonte, the CMBH Health and Sanitation Commission approved the proposal to carry out public campaigns to vaccinate dogs free of charge against leishmaniasis, the subject of PL 404/17, which was considered by the collegiate body at an ordinary meeting on December 6. This news item, as well as fulfilling its informative function, takes on the role of",propose campaigns to increase access to public services.,monitor the city's health and sanitation activities.,raise public awareness of a serious public health problem.,to defend free services to the population.,hold public officials responsible for delays in taking decisions.,2022,11,LC,C,english,"['D', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 12,"She was beautiful. She liked to dance, did theater in São Paulo and dreamed of being an actress in Hollywood. She was 13 when she got a video camera - and a sister.  The two became her companions in experimentation. As a teenager, Elena was always creating little films and was committed to directing little Petra in the scenes she invented. She was demanding of her sister. And she believed in the little girl's potential to satisfy her precocious directorial urges. For five years, she was part of some of São Paulo's best theater companies and took part in auditions for films and TV work. She was never called back. At the beginning of 1990, Elena was 20 years old when she moved to New York to study theater arts and fight for a chance in the American market. Displaced, anxious, frustrated after a few unsuccessful casting tests, disappointed by the lack of recognition and victimized by a depression that worsened with the lack of prospects, Elena ended her life in the second semester. Petra was 7 years old. Twenty years later, it is her younger sister who returns to New York to follow in her sister's footsteps, search through her archives and transform her memories into images and poetry. Elena is a movie about the sister who leaves and the sister who stays. It's a movie about the search, the loss, the longing, but also about the encounter, the legacy, the memory.  It's a movie about Petra's Elena and Elena's Petra, about what remains of one in the other and, essentially, a movie about delicacy. The text is an example of a discursive genre that fulfills the social function of","evaluate, through critical analysis, the film in question.",summarize Elena's story through the main scenes of the film.,to launch an autobiographical film through the author's life story.,"describe, through Petra's memories, the separation of two sisters.","narrate, through images and poetry, scenes from the lives of sisters Petra and Elena.",2022,12,LC,A,english,"['E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 13,"WORD - Grammars classify words as nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, pronouns, numerals, articles and prepositions. Poets classify words by their soul because they like to play with them, and to play with them you first have to be intimate with them. It is the soul of the word that defines, explains, offends or praises, that stands between the signifier and the signified to say what it wants, to give feeling to things, to make sense. The word cloud rains. The word sad cries. The word sleep sleeps. The word time passes. The word fire burns. The word knife cuts. The word car runs. The word ""word"" says. What it wants. And it never says it back. Words have bodies and souls, but they are different from people in many ways. Words say what they want, it's said, and that's that. This text by Adriana Falcão, which simulates an entry for the word ""word"", is a poem because","The poets classify words by their souls"".","establishes comparisons, as in ""Words have bodies and souls, but they are different from people"".","values the grammar of the language, as in ""noun, adjective, verb, adverb, conjunction"".","presents pertinent information about the concept of ""word"", as in ""Grammars classify words"".","uses the expressive resource of metaphor, as in ""Words have body and soul"".",2022,13,LC,E,english,"['A', 'D', 'C', 'E', 'B']"

Throw concrete on top and smooth it out. Hole, crater, loose stone, manhole bomb. After seventy, life becomes an endless obstacle course. Falls are the biggest threat to the elderly. ""Elderly"", a hateful word. Worse, just ""old age"". A fall separates old age from extreme senility. A fall destroys the chain that connects the head to the feet. Goodbye, body. At home, I go from railing to railing, touch furniture and walls, and take a bath sitting down. From the armchair to the window, from the window to the bed, from the bed to the armchair, from the armchair to the window. There it is again, the treacherous pebble trying to catch me.

QUESTION 17,"The silenced languages of Brazil In order to learn the language of his people, 29-year-old teacher Txaywa Pataxó had to study the factors that, on several occasions, almost caused the extinction of the Patxôhã language. He delved into the history of Brazil and discovered violent events that dispersed the Pataxó, who were forced to abandon their own language to escape persecution. ""The Pataxós spread out mainly after the Fire of 1951. They burned everything and expelled us from our lands. This embarrasses our people to this day,"" says Txaywa, a student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and a teacher in the village of Barra Velha, in the region of Porto Seguro (BA). More than four decades later, members of the ethnic group returned to the old site and started a movement to recover the Patxôhã language. Sameary Pataxó's children are already fluent - and she, who moved to the village as an adult, tries to learn a little from them. ""It's our identity. You say who you are through your language,"" says the elementary school teacher about the importance of restoring the Pataxó language. Patxôhã is among the indigenous languages spoken in Brazil: the IBGE estimated 274 languages in the last census. The publication Indigenous Peoples in Brazil 2011/2016, by the Socio-Environmental Institute, estimates 160. Before the arrival of the Portuguese, there were more than a thousand. The movement to recover the Patxôhã language takes on a peculiar identity character in that it",encourages the return of indigenous peoples to their lands of origin.,combines the act of ethnic resistance with the preservation of cultural memory.,denounces the process of historical persecution suffered by indigenous peoples.,associates linguistic preservation with the field of academic research.,the number of indigenous languages spoken in Brazil is increasing.,2022,17,LC,B,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'E']"

QUESTION 19,"Is he a redhead? Do you have blue eyes? Are you a man or a woman? Does he wear a hat? Anyone who played Cara a Cara as a child knows by heart the script of questions to guess who your opponent's mystery character is. Now the game is about to get a new version. Polish designer Zuzia Kozerska-Girard is developing a variation of Guess Who? in which the personalities on the board are actually notable women from history and the present day, such as artist Frida Kahlo, activist Malala Yousafzai, astronaut Valentina Tereshkova and aviator Amelia Earhart. Who's She? features a total of twenty-eight women representing different professions, nationalities and ages. The idea is that instead of asking about the characters' appearance, the questions are directed at their achievements: did they win a Nobel Prize, make a discovery? For each character there is a card with fun and interesting facts about their life. A campaign was launched to raise money to develop Who's She? The initial goal was to raise seventeen thousand dollars. Eight days before the campaign ended, the project had already raised almost three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

QUESTION 21,"Emotional urgency Martha Medeiros If everything is for yesterday, if life takes off in a hurry, if there's no more time for strategic stops, we inevitably fall into the habit of wanting love to be resolved in a split second. We're in a hurry to hear ""I love you"". We can't wait for the rules of coexistence to be established: are we boyfriends, girlfriends, married couples, lovers? Emotional urgency. A trap. We associate various words with LOVE: passion, romance, sex, adrenaline, palpitation. However, we forget the word that makes this feeling possible: ""patience"". Love without patience does not succeed. Love cannot be chewed and swallowed in an emergency, with desperate hunger. It's a meal that can last a lifetime. In this opinion piece, the linguistic marks reveal a distant situation with little formality, which is evidenced by the following","the use of metaphors, as in: ""life kicks into gear and takes off"".","repetition of a certain syntactic structure, as in: ""If everything is for yesterday"".","emphasis on the use of hyperbole, as in: ""a meal that can last a lifetime"".","building an atmosphere of urgency, in words like ""hurry"".","impersonalization throughout the text, as in: ""if there is no more time"".",2022,21,LC,A,english,"['E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 22,"The complex of speaking difficult What really matters is that the holder of notable legal knowledge knows when and how to use Portuguese version 2.0, not least because there's no need for someone to walk into a bakery in the morning with a sleepy face and say the following: ""Please, would Your Lordship have the hypothetical possibility of establishing a purchase and sale relationship with me, subject to the requirements of the Civil and Consumer Codes, so that it is possible to obtain 10 buns at a stable temperature so that the pecuniary relationship in the amount of 5 reais is fully legitimate and capable of satisfying my morning hunger?"". The problem is that we have a culture of valuing those who demonstrate that they are intelligent rather than those who are. By our logic, everyone who talks difficult tends to be more intelligent than those who value the simple, and 99.9 percent of the people in the bakery would be dumbfounded if someone used the words I said above at 7am instead of saying, ""Good morning! Could you sell me five reais worth of French bread?"". Now we get to the interesting part: what is difficult speech really? Is simply using words that most people have no idea what they are an act of speaking difficult? I don't think so, but that's how a lot of people act. Speaking difficult is making use of the simple, but with coherence and cohesion, leaving everything grammatically tied together. Speaking difficult can make someone sound intelligent, but not for long. Of course, there are times when we can't get away from far-fetched Portuguese, from legalese itself, as in the case of legal documents, among others. In this opinion piece, the author, by using a lot of fancy language in the example of buying bread, highlights the importance of(a)",speak difficult to demonstrate intelligence.,adapting language to the communication situation.,valuing the speaker's intelligence.,if you have outstanding legal knowledge.,cohesion and coherence in legal documents.,2022,22,LC,B,english,"['C', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 23,"Aware that, in the field of creation, technological innovations open up a wide range of possibilities - by allowing, and even encouraging, artists to explore in depth, in their creative process, issues such as randomness, chance, non-linearity and hypermedia - Leo Cunha comments that, as far as the field of dissemination is concerned, the alternatives are even more obvious: ""After all, the capacity for reproducing, multiplying and sharing artistic/cultural works is immense. At the same time, the dilemmas involved with the question of authorship, copyright, unauthorized reproduction and intervention, among other issues, are gaining dimension."" According to Professor Yacy-Ara Froner, the use of technological tools cannot be seen as an end in itself. This is because computers, samplers, immersion programs, the internet and intranet, video, television, radio, GPD, etc. are only supports with which artists exercise their imagination. According to the authors quoted in the text, the expansion of possibilities in the field of artistic manifestations promoted by the internet could jeopardize",mode of distribution of works.,sharing artistic works.,protection of aesthetic production.,valorization of supports.,artists' success.,2022,23,LC,C,english,"['D', 'E', 'C', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 24,"Don't count on the end of the book Umberto Eco; Jean-Claude Carrière Every time a new technique appears, it wants to demonstrate that it will repeal the rules and coercions that presided over the birth of all the other inventions of the past. It wants to be proud and unique. As if the new technique automatically brought with it, for its new users, a natural propensity to save any learning. As if it were preparing to sweep away everything that preceded it, at the same time turning all those who dared to reject it into illiterates. I have witnessed this change all my life. In reality, however, the opposite is true. Each new technique requires a long initiation into a new language, even longer insofar as our minds are shaped by the use of the languages that preceded the birth of the newcomer. The text reveals that when society promotes the development of a new technique, what most impacts its users is the",immediate supplanting of previous knowledge.,speed in learning how to use new inventions.,valuing the use of new technology.,difficulty in appropriating the new language.,recurrence of technological change.,2022,24,LC,D,english,"['D', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'C']"

QUESTION 26,"""Perfect life"" on social networks can affect mental health On the various social networks that populate the internet, so-called digital influencers are always happy and preach happiness as a lifestyle. These people spread content to thousands of followers, setting trends and showing a lifestyle dreamed of by many, such as a slim body, incredible trips, stunning houses, new cars and full-time happiness, something that is very unlikely to happen all the time, points out Carla Furtado, master in psychology and founder of the Happiness Institute. The problem can arise from the incessant search for this happiness, which generates side effects in those who consume the ""perfect life"" of others on a daily basis. Hence the concept of toxic positivity: the expression has been used to address a kind of pressure to adopt a positive discourse, combined with a life edited for social networks. In order to maintain mental health and avoid being affected by toxic positivity, the rational use of social networks is the best course of action, advises psychiatrist Renata Nayara Figueiredo, president of the Brasília Psychiatric Association (APBr). Associated with the idea of a ""perfect life"", the toxic positivity mentioned in the text is a recent social phenomenon that is based on",idealized and harmful standards of physical beauty.,lifestyles that are inaccessible to Brazilian society.,stereotypical and superficial representations of happiness.,contradictory attitudes of digital influencers.,contemporary resignifications of the concept of joy.,2022,26,LC,C,english,"['E', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'B']"
QUESTION 27,"TEXT 1 Image description: The work Laocoonte, by El Greco, in oil on canvas, shows, in the foreground, a drawing of five naked human figures positioned on a rocky area, with a city in the background. In the central part of the picture, two men are lying on their backs on the rocky ground, their heads close together in opposite directions. One has white hair and a white beard and is holding the neck of a snake with his right hand and the central part of the animal's body with his left hand. The snake has its mouth wide open next to the man's head, trying to bite him. To the right of the image are two standing human figures. One is on his back and the other has his body facing forward and his face to the side. On the left-hand side of the screen, there is a figure of a man, with a slender body and his genitals showing. His right arm is bent upwards and backwards, and his left arm is stretched out at the side of his body, holding a snake by the middle and tail, which seems to be stinging him in the abdomen. TEXT 2 This impressive work shows the priest Laocoon being punished by the gods for trying to warn the Trojans of the threat of the Trojan Horse, which was hiding a group of Greek soldiers. Sent by the gods, sea serpents are seen killing Laocoon and his two sons as a form of punishment. Produced at the beginning of the 17th century, the Mannerist work stands out for its",representation of male nudity.,distortion when representing the human figure.,using perspective to integrate the different planes.,presence of the theme of death as punishment for the family.,evocation of a fact from classical Greek culture.,2022,27,LC,B,english,"['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 28,"TEXT 1 Image description: Untitled work by Donald Judd, from 1969, made up of ten rectangular blocks, which appear to be fixed to a wall, one above the other, at a symmetrical distance from each other. The shape of the blocks is reminiscent of boxes. Untitled TEXT 2 Although it wasn't an organized group or movement, Minimalism was one of many labels (including primary structures, unitary objects, ABC art and Cool Art) applied by critics to describe the apparently simple structures that some artists were creating. When minimalist art began to emerge, many critics and an opinionated public judged it to be cold, anonymous and unforgivable. The prefabricated industrial materials often used didn't look like ""art"".

QUESTION 29,"Naked in boots Antônio Prata Vanda came from the interior of Minas Gerais and from inside a Charles Dickens book. With no money to raise her, her mother had given her to an acquaintance when she was seven. On receiving her, the woman asked what the little girl liked to eat. She wrote everything down on a piece of paper. As soon as her mother turned her back, however, the woman crumpled up the list and, like a villain in a soap opera, decreed: ""From today onwards, you won't even smell these foods!"". Vanda worked there until she was fifteen, when she received a letter from a cousin with a hundred cruzeiros note, left home in her body clothes and fled on a bus to São Paulo. Every time my sister and I pestered her with our spoiled-child demands, she would tell us stories about her childhood as a Cinderella, make us squeeze her nose, broken by one of the ""boss's"" daughters, with a rolling pin and kick us out of the kitchen: ""Get out of there, you pest, and let me finish this dinner"".

QUESTION 30,"TEXT 1 Image description: Installation entitled In absentia, by Regina Silveira, from 1983, which features the projection of the image of a bicycle wheel mounted on a stool. There is a white box on the floor, from which the projection begins. TEXT 2 The term ready-made was coined by Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) to designate a type of object, invented by him, consisting of one or more everyday articles, mass-produced, selected without aesthetic criteria and exhibited as works of art in specialized spaces (museums and galleries). His first ready-made, from 1912, is a bicycle wheel mounted on a stool (Bicycle wheel). By transforming any object into a work of art, the artist carried out a radical critique of the art system. The installation In absentia proposes a dialog with the ready-made Bicycle wheel, demonstrating that",the creations demystify established aesthetic values.,"the absent object suggests the degradation of the form, surpassing the artistic model.",the recurrence of themes marks the art of the late 20th century.,the ways of criticizing works from the past are repeated.,time distancing allows for the transformation of aesthetic references.,2022,30,LC,A,english,"['C', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 31,"Recife was buzzing in the early 1990s, and artists were working to restore the prestige of Pernambuco culture. It was necessary to draw inspiration, literally, from the roots on which the city was built. That's when, in 1992, with the publication of a manifesto written by musician and journalist Fred Zero Quatro, from the band Mundo Livre S/A, manguebeat was born. The name comes from ""mangue"", the typical vegetation of the region, and ""beat"", to represent the beats and musical influences that the movement would embrace from then on. It was the time and place for the crabs - to which the musicians from Recife liked to compare themselves - to show their faces: maracatu and its implements were mixed with hip-hop beats, rock guitars, electronic elements and Chico Science's Recife accent. The search for the new has yielded a different perspective of Brazil when looking at Recife. The city is no longer just a place for frevo and carnival, but has become a musical hotbed that continues to thrive even 25 years after the release of Nação Zumbi's first album, Da lama ao caos. Chico Science was fundamental to the renewal of Pernambuco's music, a fact that was brought about by the","integration of cultural references from different origins, creating a new aesthetic combination.",the use of electronic musical devices instead of traditional instruments.,occupying local natural spaces to produce memorable musical events.,"replacing old musical practices, such as frevo, with innovative melodies and harmonies.",recovery of traditional folk compositions and their presentation at major festivals.,2022,31,LC,A,english,"['E', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 32,"The slave Maria Firmina dos Reis - I'm amazed,"" said a lady with sincerely abolitionist sentiments, ""I'm even amazed at how one can feel and express slave sentiments in this century, in the nineteenth century! Religious morality and civic morality stand up and speak loudly, crushing the hydra that poisons the family in its most sacred sanctuary, and demoralizes and demeans the entire nation! Raise your eyes to Golgotha, or look around society, and tell me: - What was the sacrifice of the Man God, who breathed his last breath there? Ah, so it's not true that his blood was man's ransom! Is it an abominable lie that his blood bought freedom? And then, look at society... Don't you see the vulture that is constantly eating away at it... Don't you feel the demoralization that is engulfing it, the cancer that is destroying it? Whichever way you look at it, slavery is and always will be a great evil. This is the reason for the decline of commerce, because commerce and agriculture go hand in hand, and slaves cannot make agriculture flourish, because their work is forced. Inscribed in the romantic aesthetic of Brazilian literature, the tale reveals aspects of national reality in the 19th century by",ironizing the behavior of landowners in the exploitation of labor.,linking the decline in agricultural and commercial production to racial issues.,suggest practices of physical and moral violence in the name of material progress.,reveal the imposition of religious beliefs on enslaved people.,point out the hypocrisy of the conservative discourse in defense of slavery.,2022,32,LC,E,english,"['E', 'D', 'C', 'A', 'B']"
QUESTION 33,"TEXT 1 Electronic Wall Project developed at INT, similar to a totem pole, promises to make access to information available to everyone The inclusion of people with disabilities has been one of the main challenges and concerns for society over the last few decades. And the use of technology has proved to be a fundamental ally in many initiatives aimed at this area. An example of this is one of the recent creations of the National Institute of Technology (INT) - a research unit of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC). There, with the aim of ensuring that differences between people are not synonymous with obstacles in access to information or communication, engineers and technologists have been working on the development of the Electronic Wall project. The Electronic Wall was born out of the need to promote inclusion in schools. With a multimedia and interactive interface, everyone can access the Mural Eletrônico. Through the equipment, videos with Libras can be made available, as well as audio reading of texts, which will also be accessible on a dynamic braille platform next to the keyboard. TEXT 2 Surdonews project, developed at UFRJ, guarantees deaf people access to information and contributes to their ""scientific inclusion"" In order not to allow the lack of information to be a factor in the isolation and inaccessibility of the deaf community, journalist and researcher Roberta Savedra Schiaffino created the project ""Surdonews: assembling the puzzles of news for the deaf"". It is a Facebook page with constantly updated news presented by deaf people in Libras and broadcast via videos. The idea to create the project came about when Roberta, who is profoundly deaf herself, was still studying for her master's degree. To do this, she tried to establish a diagnosis of informal knowledge among people with deafblindness. She interviewed fifty deaf elementary school pupils and saw that they had great difficulty reading, as well as not understanding the spoken news. ""This is very serious, because 90 percent of an individual's knowledge comes from informal knowledge, acquired at science fairs, conversations, cinema, theater, including the media, for all its disseminating possibilities,"" explains the researcher. ""We value scientific content in our stories. However, regardless of this, our main job is, in addition to informing and updating, to ensure that the texts are not impoverished in the 'translation' process, but are accessible."" Considering the theme of technologies and accessibility, texts 1 and 2 are similar because they present projects that",aim to disseminate knowledge.,were created by a deaf researcher.,originated in a postgraduate course.,guarantee equality between people.,are limited to the institutional space of the school.,2022,33,LC,A,english,"['E', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'D']"

QUESTION 35,"Esaú e Jacó Machado de Assis Bárbara entered, while her father picked up his guitar and went to the stone landing at the door on the left. She was a slight, short creature, with an embroidered skirt and slippers on her feet. There was no denying her attractive body. Her hair, caught at the top of her head by a piece of shredded ribbon, made a natural headdress, the tassel of which was supplied by a sprig of rue. There was a bit of a priestess about her. The mystery was in her eyes. They were opaque, but not so much so that they weren't also lucid and sharp, and in the latter state they were just as long; so long and so sharp that they would go down our throats, revolve the heart and come back out, ready for another entrance and another revolving. I won't lie to you by saying that the two felt this or that fascination. Barbara questioned them; Natividade told her what she had come for and gave her the portraits of her children and the haircuts, because she had been told that it was enough. - That's enough, Barbara confirmed. Are the children yours? - Yes. In the account of the visit of two rich women to a fortune-teller in Morro do Castelo, irony - one of the most representative features of Machado's narrative - consists of the following",the way the residents of the Rio de Janeiro slums dress.,practical sense in relation to income opportunities.,the narrator's interest in ambiguous female figures.,mystery that surrounds the clients of clairvoyant practices.,a mixture of simplicity and cunning in the character's gestures.,2022,35,LC,E,english,"['A', 'B', 'E', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 36,"Dona Guidinha do Poço Manuel de Oliveira Paiva The lady manifested herself through actions, gestures and, above all, a certain silence that was bitter and flaying.

[...] The black women were ordered to put the people of that compadre Silveira to work: the sisters-in-law, at the spindle; the brothers-in-law, in the fields, tending to the cattle with the cowboys; his wife and sisters, to take care of the brood. Margarida hadn't had any children, and as she wanted them with all her might, she always treated the little ones and the mothers who were raising them well. This wasn't Christian sentimentality or tenderness, it was the selfish and raw instinct of motherhood, acting out of mere carnal sympathy. As for the father of the lot (he was referring to Antônio), let him go and help the cowboy with the beasts. Orders given, Quinquim agreed. Each one moralized the other, in order to moralize themselves. In this excerpt from the naturalist novel, the way in which the narrator judges the behavior and emotions of the female characters reveals the influence of thought","scientific, considering the human being as a biological phenomenon.","liberal, seeking equality between enslaved and free people.","religious, based on faith and acceptance of the dogmas of Christianity.","affection, manifested in the determination to welcome family members and in mutual respect.","capitalist, marked by the functional distribution of labor.",2022,36,LC,A,english,"['C', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'A']"

A resurrection of old cemeteries - skeletons coming back to life, with the earthy appearance and stench of rotten graves. The maimed ghosts were dancing, so unsteady and trembling, with the dragging steps of those who carry their legs instead of being carried by them. They walked slowly, looking back, as if they wanted to go back. They were in no hurry to arrive, because they didn't know where they were going. Expelled from their paradise by fiery swords, they went off at random, in the dragnet of bad fates. They fled from the sun and the sun guided them in this forced nomadism. They grew thinner and thinner, as if the wind were lifting them up. And their fine-tuned arms came down to their knees, their hands waving. Scouts were coming. Except for the hydropics - from ascites following toxic food - with their alarming bellies. They had no sex, no age, no condition. They were retreatants. Nothing more. The compositional features that place the work in the so-called ""Romance of the 1930s"" in Brazilian literature are manifested here in the following",lyrical contemplation of the landscape transformed into an allegory.,the narrator's political engagement with inequality.,psychological analysis of the characters' reaction to the drought.,the spaces are undefined for the purpose of generalization.,a raw depiction of the dramatic reality of the retirantes.,2022,37,LC,E,english,"['E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']"

QUESTION 39,"O bebé de tarlatana rosa João do Rio - [...] On Tuesday I disconnected from the group and fell into the high seas of depravity, alone, with a light garment over my skin and all my bad instincts buffeted. The whole city was like that. It's the moment when, behind masks, girls confess their passions to boys, it's the moment when the most secret liaisons come to light, when virginity is dubious, and we all think it's useless, honor a chastisement, common sense a drudgery. At that moment anything is possible, the greatest absurdities, the greatest crimes; at that moment there is a laughter that galvanizes the senses and the kiss is naturally unleashed. I was trepidatious, with an almost morbid eagerness to flirt. There were no perfumed, well-known girls from the galarin, no familiar contact, but anonymous debauchery, the ritual debauchery of arriving, picking up, finishing, continuing. It was ignoble.

Analysis of the data allows us to say that the lack of access to the web repeats the same adversities and exclusions already seen in Brazilian society with regard to illiterate people, those with less schooling, black people, the indigenous population and the unemployed. This means that if the internet doesn't directly produce exclusion, it certainly reproduces it, given that those who access it the most are precisely the youngest, most educated, most highly paid, skilled workers, men and whites.
