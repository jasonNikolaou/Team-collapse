QUESTION 136,"The decimal numbering system is the most commonly used in everyday life. In this system, each natural number is written as a sum of powers of ten, each multiplied by a number from 0 to 9. For example, the number 3,256 is equal to 3 times (10 to the power of 3) plus 2 times (10 to the power of 2) plus 5 times 10 plus 6 times (10 to the power of 0). Computers, on the other hand, process their data using the binary numbering system, which follows a similar logic to decimal: each natural is written as a sum of powers of 2, each of which is multiplied by 0 or 1. The table shows how natural numbers from 1 to 10 are denoted in the binary system. Description of the table:  1 is described as: one; 2 is described as: one zero; 3 is described as: one one; 4 is described as: one zero zero; 5 is described as: one zero one; 6 is described as: one one zero; 7 is described as: one one one; 8 is described as: one zero zero; 9 is described as: one zero zero one; 10 is described as: one zero one zero. When a computer user connects to his work's Internet network, he receives a connection protocol, given by the binary number one zero one zero one zero . To make a maintenance request on their network, the relevant team asks for the protocol number to be entered in the decimal system. The protocol number to be entered by the user is",102.,18.,42.,84.,222.,2020,136,MT,C,english,"['D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 137,"Suppose that a car racing team has five types of tire (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), in which the climate efficiency factor EC (index that provides the behavior of the tire in use, depending on the climate) is shown: - EC of tire 1: with rain 6, without rain 3; - EC of tire 2 : with rain 7, without rain -4; - EC of tire 3 : with rain -2, without rain 10; - EC of tire 4: with rain 2, without rain 8; - EC of tire 5 : with rain -6, without rain 7.

QUESTION 176,"Zipf's Law, named after the American linguist George Zipf, is an empirical law that relates the frequency ( f ) of a word in a given text to its rank ( r ). It is given by f equals A divided by (r raised to B). The word's ranking is its position when sorting the words in order of frequency. In other words, r is equal to 1 for the most frequent word, r is equal to 2 for the second most frequent word and so on.A and B are positive constants. Based on the values of X equal to the logarithm of r and Y equal to the logarithm of f , it is possible to estimate values for A and B .

QUESTION 177,"While a being is alive, the amount of carbon 14 in it doesn't change. When it dies, the amount decreases. It is known that the half-life of carbon 14 is 5,730 years, which means that in a fossil of an organism that died 5,730 years ago there will be half the carbon 14 that existed when it was alive. Scientists and archaeologists therefore use the following formula to find out the age of a fossil found: Q of t is equal to Q zero multiplied by 2 to the negative power of the fraction of numerator t and denominator 5 730, where t is time, measured in years, Q of t is the amount of carbon 14 measured at time t and Q zero is the amount of carbon 14 in the corresponding living being. During one of their expeditions, a group of archaeologists found 5 fossils of known species and measured the amount of carbon 14 in them. In the table we have these values together with the amount of carbon 14 in these living species. Description of the table: the table shows the equivalences of the amount of carbon 14 in the following fossils: Fossil 1: Q zero is equal to 128 and Q of t is equal to 32; Fossil 2: Q zero is equal to 256 and Q of t is equal to 8; Fossil 3: Q zero is equal to 512 and Q of t is equal to 64; Fossil 4: Q zero is equal to 1 024 and Q of t is equal to 512; Fossil 5: Q zero is equal to 2 048 and Q of t is equal to 128.
