QUESTION 137,"In an online game, each player seeks to level up and increase their experience, which are two important parameters in the game on which the participant's defense and attack strengths depend. Each player's defense strength is directly proportional to their level and the square of their experience, while their attack strength is directly proportional to their experience and the square of their level. No player knows the level or experience of the others. Players start the game at level 1 with experience 1 and have attack strength 2 and defense strength 1. In this game, each player moves around a city in search of treasures to increase their experience. When two of them meet, one of them can challenge the other to a confrontation, with the challenger being considered the attacker. The attacking force of the challenger is then compared to the defending force of the challenged and the one whose force is greater wins the match. The winner of the challenge increases their level by one unit. If the match is tied, both players increase their levels by one.

QUESTION 170,"A construction company wants to connect a central reservoir (R c ) in the shape of a cylinder, with an internal radius of 2 meters and an internal height of 3.30 meters, to four auxiliary cylindrical reservoirs (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 ), which have internal radii and internal heights measuring 1.5 meters.

QUESTION 172,"A group of engineers is designing an engine whose piston's vertical displacement scheme inside the combustion chamber is shown in the figure. Figure description: The figure shows an engine schematic formed by a rectangle representing a combustion chamber. At the bottom of the rectangle is the piston with its upper part inside the chamber, in a horizontal position; this upper part is attached to a vertical rod that makes circular movements. The figure shows two instants: an instant equal to 0 and an instant other than 0. At an instant equal to 0, the piston is positioned at the base of the chamber and its height as a function of time 0 is equal to 0. At a time other than 0, the piston is positioned inside the chamber, its height is a function of time t, and its rod has made a counterclockwise movement of approximately 90 degrees. The function h of t is equal to 4 plus 4 sine of (fraction with numerator beta times t and denominator 2, minus fraction with numerator pi and denominator 2) defined for t greater than or equal to 0 describes how the height h , measured in centimeters, of the top of the piston inside the combustion chamber varies as a function of time t , measured in seconds. The figures show the heights of the piston at two different times. The value of the parameter beta , which is given by a positive integer, is related to the speed at which the piston moves. For the engine to have good power, it is necessary and sufficient that, in less than 4 seconds from the start of operation (instant t equal to 0 ), the height of the base of the piston reaches the value of 6 centimeters three times. For the calculations, use 3 as an approximation for pi .
