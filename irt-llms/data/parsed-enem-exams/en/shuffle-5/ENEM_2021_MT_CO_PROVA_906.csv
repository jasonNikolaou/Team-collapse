QUESTION 136,"The Roman numeral system is still used to indicate chapters and volumes of books, to designate centuries and, in chronological order, popes and kings of the same name. Seven letters of the alphabet are used: Four fundamental: | (worth 1); X (worth 10); C (worth 100) and M (worth 1,000). Three secondary letters: V (worth 5); L (worth 50) and D (worth 500). The rules for writing Roman numerals are: 1. there is no symbol corresponding to zero; 2. the fundamental symbols can be repeated up to three times and their values added together. Example: XXX is equal to 30; 3. A letter placed to the left of another of greater value indicates subtraction of the respective values. Example: IX equals 10 minus 1 equals 9; 4. A letter placed to the right of another letter of greater value indicates addition of the respective values. Example: XI equals 10 plus 1 equals 11. In a European city there is a plaque indicating the year of its foundation: MCDLXIX. How many years will this city have been founded in 2050?",601,379,381,579,581,2021,136,MT,E,english,"['E', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 137,"One of the most commonly used bases for representing a number is the decimal base. However, computers work with numbers in binary base. In this base, any natural number is represented using only the digits O and 1. For example, the representations of the numbers 9 and 12, in binary base, are (one zero zero one) and (one one zero zero) respectively. The addition operation in binary base follows a similar algorithm to that used in decimal base, as detailed in the picture: enemo021 VODOO enemo021 Picture description: The picture shows the following information: ""a, b and a plus b"". When a equals zero and b equals zero, a plus b equals zero. When a equals zero and b equals one, a plus b equals one. When a equals one and b equals zero, a plus b equals one. When a equals one and b equals one, a plus b equals (one zero).   VICUIU For example, in the binary base, the sum of the numbers (one zero)and (one zero)is (one zero zero) as shown: Image description: Addition: (one zero)plus (one zero)equals (one zero zero). Considering the information in the text, the result of adding 9 plus 12 will be represented, in binary base, by", (one zero one zero one)., (one one one one), (one one zero zero one)., (one one zero one)., (one zero one).,2021,137,MT,A,english,"['D', 'C', 'E', 'B', 'A']"
