 QUESTÃO 1,"Becoming

Back in the ancestral homeland of Michelle Obama,
black women were rarely granted the honorific Miss or
Mrs., but were addressed by their first name, or simply
as “gal” or “auntie” or worse. This so openly demeaned
them that many black women, long after they had left the
South, refused to answer if called by their first name. A
mother and father in 1970s Texas named their newborn
“Miss” so that white people would have no choice but to
address their daughter by that title. Black women were
meant for the field or the kitchen, or for use as they saw
fit. They were, by definition, not ladies. The very idea of
a black woman as first lady of the land, well, that would
have been unthinkable.

A crítica do livro de memórias de Michelle Obama,
ex-primeira-dama dos EUA, aborda a história das relações

CELINE

Americans always think Europe is perfect. But such
beauty and history can be really oppressive. It reduces the
individual to nothing. It just reminds you all the time you
are just a little speck in a long history, where in America
you feel like you could be making history. That's why I like
Los Angeles because it is so...

JESSE

Ugly?

CELINE

No, I was going to say “neutral”. It's like looking at a
blank canvas. I think people go to places like Venice on
their honeymoon to make sure they are not going to fight
for the first two weeks of their marriage because they'll
be too busy looking around at all the beautiful things.
That's what people call a romantic place — somewhere
where the prettiness will contain your primary violent
instinct. A real good honeymoon spot would be like
somewhere in New Jersey.

QUESTÃO 4,"We are now a nation obsessed with the cult of
celebrity. Celebrities have replaced the classic notion
of the hero. But instead of being respected for talent,
courage or intelligence, itis money, style and image the
deciding factors in what commands respect. Image is
everything. Their image is painstakingly constructed by
a multitude of different image consultants to carve out
the most profitable celebrity they can. Then society is
right behind them, believing in everything that celebrity
believes in. Companies know that people will buy a
product if a celebrity has it too. It is as if the person
buying the product feels that they now have some
kind of connection with the celebrity and that some of
their perceived happiness will now be passed onto the
consumer. So to look at it one way, the cult of celebrity
is really nothing more than a sophisticated marketing
scheme. Celebrities though cannot be blamed for all
negative aspects of society. In reality society is to
blame. We are the people who seemed to have lost
the ability to think for ourselves. I suppose it's easier to
be told what to think, rather than challenging what we
are told. The reason we are swamped by celebrity is
because there is a demand for it.

que una problemática: lo social. La obra que no siga esa
dirección está condenada al fracaso, aunque sea muy
buena”. En su última entrevista, de junio de 1936, Lorca
se muestra profético: “Ni el poeta ni nadie tiene la clave y
el secreto del mundo. Quiero ser bueno. Sé que la poesia
eleva y creo firmemente que si hay un más allá tendré la
agradable sorpresa de encontrarme con él. Pero el dolor
del hombre y la injusticia constante que mana del mundo,

something of his own, a real and ready inspiration, a polka,
a boisterous polka, as the ads say. No
no repulsion on the composer's part; his fingers were plucking out
the notes, connecting them, wiggling them; you could say that the muse was
composed and danced at the same time. [...] She composed alone,
typing or writing, without the vain efforts of the day before,
without exasperation, without asking anything of heaven, without questioning
Mozart's eyes. No boredom. Life, grace, novelty,
flowed from his soul like a perennial fountain.

TEXT 2

A famous man exposes the ordeal of the popular musician
the sublimity of the classical masterpiece, and with it the
masterpiece, and with it the gallery of the immortals, but who is betrayed
by an uncontrollable inner disposition that pushes him
relentlessly in the opposite direction. Pestana, famous in
soirees, salons, balls and streets of Rio de Janeiro for his
irresistibly danceable compositions, hides
from the rumors around him in a room filled with icons
of great European music, immersed himself in the sonatas of Viennese
Viennese classicism, prepares himself for the supreme creative leap
supreme creative leap and, before you know it, you're the author of yet another
inescapable and bouncy polka.

Machado de Assis' short story makes a veiled reference to the
maxixe, a musical genre initially associated with slavery
and mixed race. In Text 2, the character's conflict in
composing works of this genre is representative of","prevalence of African musical references in the
Brazilian population.","little musical complexity in the compositions
adjusted to the tastes of the general public.","tense relationship between the erudite and the popular in the
constitution of Brazilian music.","importance attributed to classical music in
Brazilian society in the 19th century.","incipient attribution of social prestige to music

QUESTION 41,"Slowly, slowly

Slowing down is necessary. Speeding up is not necessary.
In a hurry and focused on our own navels, we operate,
robotic speech and glacial silence. This
this state of mind well in the song Sinal fechado
(1969), by Paulinho da Viola. It's the story of
two guys who meet unexpectedly at
a traffic light. The conversation between the two, however,
took place quickly. Soon, the characters
say goodbye, promising to see each other another time.
opportunity. It is clear that the communication
empty and superficial, the emphasis of which was the light and superficial contact
interlocutors: ""Hello, how are you?
How are you? / I'm going, how are you? / Fine, I'll run
I'm going to run, / to take my place in the future. And you?
All right, I'm off in search of a / peaceful sleep,
who knows? / How long... / Well, how long...
/ Forgive my haste / it's the soul of our business... /
Oh, you're welcome. / I'm only going a hundred too"".

The cult of speed, in the context presented, is
as the result of a procedural immediacy that
celebrates the achievement of ends without considering the quality of the
quality of the means necessary to achieve
purpose. This situation favors the law of least effort
- convenience - and undermines the law of greater effort - dignity.

As an alternative model to fast culture, we have the
slow life movement, whose purpose, in a nutshell, is to
to make people aware that haste is the enemy of
perfection and pleasure, thus seeking to re-educate their senses to better
their senses to better enjoy the flavors of life.

In this opinion piece, the presentation of the lyrics to the song
Sinal fechado is an argumentative strategy
that aims to sensitize the reader because","presents solutions to the rush culture that people
people experience today.","contrasts situations of acceleration and serenity
in people's lives.","questions the cliché about the speed and acceleration of
modern life.","exemplifies the fact criticized in the text with a concrete situation.

QUESTION 42,"The documentary O Menino que fez um Museu,
directed by Sérgio Utsch, an independent production by
Brazilians and British, recorded in the Northeast in 2016,
more precisely in the Dom Quintino district, in rural
district of Crato, was awarded a prize in London by the FPA (Foreign
Press Association), the world's oldest
Foreign Correspondents' Association, founded in 1888.

According to the director, The Boy Who Made a Museum

Lucas Feitosa, 11 years old.

When he was 10 years old, Pedro Lucas created the Museu
Museum, located in the district of Dom Quintino.
The idea came about after a visit he made in
2013, when he was 8 years old, to the Gonzagão Museum,
in Exu, Pernambuco. Pedro decided to create his own
place to pay homage to the king and the chosen location
was his late great-grandmother's house, which is next door to his house on
his house, in Alto de Antena street.

In the second paragraph, a quote states that the
documentary ""was the only work produced by teams
outside the United States-Europe axis among the finalists"".
In the text, this resource expresses an
strategy that reinforces the","feat of awarding a story set in the Brazilian
Northeast of Brazil.","
importance of the partnership between Brazilians and British
for the filming.","lack of investment in independent
production in the country.","originality of the initiative to pay tribute to the life and work of

QUESTION 45,"The dredger
Manoel de Barros


We didn't know if that dredger had been born there,
in Porto, like a tree or a dune.
