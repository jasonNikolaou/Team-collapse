QUESTION 01,"One of the things that made an incredible impression on me in the ﬁlm was Frida’s comfort in and celebration of her own unique beauty. She didn’t try to ﬁt into conventional ideas or images about womanhood or what makes someone or something beautiful. Instead, she fully inhabited her own unique gifts, not particularly caring what other people thought. She was magnetic and beautiful in her own right. She painted for years, not to be a commercial success or to be discovered, but to express her own inner pain, joy, family, love and culture. She absolutely and resolutely was who she was. The trueness of her own unique vision and her ability to stand ﬁrmly in her own truth was what made her successful in the end.

QUESTION 02,"British Government to Recruit Teens as Next Generation of Spies In the 50 years since the ﬁrst James Bond movie created a lasting impression of a British secret agent, a completely different character is about to emerge. Britain’s intelligence agencies are to recruit their next generation of cyber spies by harnessing the talents of the “Xbox generation”. In an expansion of a pilot program, Foreign Secretary William Hague announced Thursday that up to 100 18-year-olds will be given the chance to train for a career in Britain’s secret services. The move to recruit  school-leavers marks a break with the past, when agencies mainly drew their staff from among university graduates. “Young people are the key to our country’s future success, just as they were during the War”, Hague said. “Today we are not at war, but I see evidence every day of deliberate, organized attacks against intellectual property and government networks in the United Kingdom.” The new recruitment program, called the Single Intelligence Account apprenticeship scheme will enable students with suitable qualiﬁcations in science, technology or engineering, to spend two years learning about communications, security and engineering through formal education, technical training and work placements. Segundo informações veiculadas pela NBC News, a geração digital já tem seu espaço conquistado nas agências britânicas de inteligência. O governo britânico decidiu que",enfrentará a guerra vigente e deliberada contra a propriedade intelectual no Reino Unido.,abandonará a política de contratação de universitários como agentes secretos.,recrutará jovens jogadores de Xbox como ciberespiões das agências de inteligência.,implantará um esquema de capacitação de adolescentes para atuarem como agentes secretos.,anunciará os nomes dos jovens a serem contratados pelas agências de inteligência.,2017,2,LC,D,english

QUESTION 04,"Letters Children and Guns Published: May 7, 2013 To the Editor: Re “Girl’s Death by Gunshot Is Rejected as Symbol” (news article, May 6): I ﬁnd it abhorrent that the people of Burkesville, Ky., are not willing to learn a lesson from the tragic shooting of a 2-year- old girl by her 5-year-old brother. I am not judging their lifestyle of introducing guns to children at a young age, but I do feel that it’s irresponsible not to practice basic safety with anything potentially lethal — guns, knives, ﬁre and so on. How can anyone justify leaving guns lying around, unlocked and possibly loaded, in a home with two young children?  I wish the family of the victim comfort during this difﬁcult time, but to dismiss this as a simple accident leaves open the potential for many more such “accidents” to occur.  I hope this doesn’t have to happen several more times for legislators to realize that something needs to be changed.

QUESTION 05,"Israel Travel Guide Israel has always been a standout destination. From the days of prophets to the modern day nomad this tiny slice of land on the eastern Mediteranean has long attracted visitors. While some arrive in the ‘Holy Land’ on a spiritual quest, many others are on cultural tours, beach holidays and eco-tourism trips. Weeding through Israel’s convoluted history is both exhilarating and exhausting. There are crumbling temples, ruined cities, abandoned forts and hundreds of places associated with the Bible. And while a sense of adventure is required, most sites are safe and easily accessible. Most of all, Israel is about its incredibly diverse population. Jews come from all over the world to live here, while about 20% of the population is Muslim. Politics are hard to get away from in Israel as everyone has an opinion on how to move the country forward — with a ready ear you’re sure to hear opinions from every side o f the political spectru m.

QUESTION 02,"El virus del papiloma humano (HPV) también es un problema de hombres Para algunos hombres, el virus del papiloma humano (HPV) es algo muy lejano. Se olvidan de que ellos también se infectan y de que, al contagiarnos, nos están regalando un pasaporte mágico para el cáncer cérvico-uterino — segunda causa de muerte entre las mujeres de México —; incluso me ha tocado escuchar en boca de algunos de ellos que “sólo se trata de una infeccioncita”. Pues bien, el HPV también es un problema de hombres, no sólo porque propaga la infección entre la población femenina, sino también porque este virus produce otros problemas de salud tanto en hombres como en mujeres, incluyendo verrugas genitales y cáncer de boca y garganta que, si bien no son tan conocidos o alarmantes por su cantidad, como otros tipos de cáncer, también constituyen un riesgo. Por lo anterior, la Academia Americana de Pediatría decidió enfrentarse al HPV mediante vacunas que se ponen tanto a mujeres como hombres. Los especialistas aﬁrman que la vacuna es más efectiva si se administra antes de que el niño se vuelva sexualmente activo, y responde mejor en el organismo de varones entre 9 y 15 años. O texto aborda a temática do HPV. Ao discorrer sobre o contágio e a prevenção do papiloma humano, a autora informa aos leitores que esse vírus é",estudado pela Academia Americana de Pediatria por seus efeitos em crianças.,responsável pelo aumento de casos de câncer na população jovem mexicana.,ignorado pelos homens por se restringir à população feminina.,combatido por vacinas que devem ser aplicadas tanto em mulheres quanto em homens.,classiﬁcado como um problema superável pela facilidade com que se enfrenta a infecção.,2017,2,LC,D,spanish

QUESTION 04,"Emotivo encuentro en la universidad pública El entonces mandatario uruguayo recibió el cariño de sus compatriotas residentes en Nueva York e informó sobre la evolución del país, las políticas de gobierno, los avances y cuentas pendientes. Como en ocasiones similares, se multiplicaron las muestras de respeto y emoción. “Una nación es un formidable sentimiento de un ‘nosotros’”, dijo. Mujica comenzó su discurso relatando lo recogido de otras experiencias de comunidades en el exilio. “Muchos de ustedes echaron raíces, tienen hijos y no pueden cometer la agresión de descuajarle la vida. Tienen que cargar con esa nostalgia de ser de allá, pero estar acá”, dijo. “Estamos metidos en la lucha por mejorar las circunstancias, con el sueño de que las generaciones que vengan, puedan venir con más soltura, con más apoyo”, dijo el Presidente. Mujica se reﬁrió a algunas críticas que reciben algunas políticas sociales. “Nos acusan de que damos sin contrapartida. Nos dicen ‘a la gente no hay que darle pescado, sino enseñarle a pescar’. Sí — razonó el Presidente —, pero cuando le afanaste la caña, le afanaste el bote, ¿qué le vas a pedir?

QUESTION 05,"El eclipse Cuando Fray Bartolomé Arrazola se sintió perdido aceptó que ya nada podría salvarlo. La selva poderosa de Guatemala lo había apresado, implacable y deﬁnitiva. Ante su ignorancia topográﬁca se sentó con tranquilidad a esperar la muerte. Al despertar se encontró rodeado por un grupo de indígenas de rostro impasible que se disponía a sacriﬁcarlo ante un altar, un altar que a Bartolomé le pareció como el lecho en que descansaría, al ﬁn, de sus temores, de su destino, de sí mismo. Tres años en el país le habían conferido un mediano dominio de las lenguas nativas. Intentó algo. Dijo algunas palabras que fueron comprendidas. Entonces floreció en él una idea que tuvo por digna de su talento y de su cultura universal y de su arduo conocimiento de Aristóteles. Recordó que para ese día se esperaba un eclipse total de sol. Y dispuso, en lo más íntimo, valerse de aquel conocimiento para engañar a sus opresores y salvar la vida. — Si me matáis — les dijo — puedo hacer que el sol se oscurezca en su altura.  Los indígenas lo miraron ﬁjamente y Bartolomé sorprendió la incredulidad en sus ojos. Vio que se produjo un pequeño consejo, y esperó conﬁado, no sin cierto desdén.  Dos horas después el corazón de Fray Bartolomé Arrazola chorreaba su sangre vehemente sobre la piedra de los sacriﬁcios (brillante bajo la opaca luz de un sol eclipsado), mientras uno de los indígenas recitaba sin ninguna inflexión de voz, sin prisa, una por una las inﬁnitas fechas en que se producirían eclipses solares y lunares, que los astrónomos de la comunidad maya habían previsto y anotado en sus códices sin la valiosa ayuda de Aristóteles. No texto, confrontam-se duas visões de mundo: a da cultura ocidental, representada por Frei Bartolomé Arrazola, e a da mítica pré-hispânica, representada pela comunidade indígena maia. Segundo a narrativa,",os catequizadores espanhóis avalizam os saberes produzidos pelas comunidades indígenas hispano-americanas.,os indígenas da comunidade maia mostram-se perplexos diante da superioridade do conhecimento aristotélico do frei espanhol.,"o catequizador espanhol Arrazola apresenta-se adaptado às culturas autóctones, ao promover a interlocução entre os conhecimentos aristotélico e indígena.","o episódio representa, de forma neutra, o signiﬁcado do conhecimento ancestral indígena, quando comparado ao conhecimento ocidental.","os conhecimentos acadêmicos de Arrazola são insuﬁcientes para salvá-lo da morte, ante a sabedoria astronômica da cultura maia.

QUESTION 06,"Romans used social networks 2,000 years ago, says book When you tweet or comment under the post of one of your many friends on Facebook, you probably feel privileged to live at a time in history when it is possible to immediately reach a vast network of contacts with a simple click of the ""send"" button. You may also reflect on how past generations were able to live without social media, deprived of the ability to see and be seen, to receive, generate and interact with an immense load of information. But what you may not know is that human beings have been using social interaction tools for over two thousand years. This is what Tom Standage, author of the book Writing on the Wall - Social Media, The first 2 000 Years, claims. According to Standage, Marco Tulio Cicero, a Roman philosopher and politician, was, along with other members of the Roman elite, a forerunner in the use of social networks. The author tells how Cicero used a slave, who later became his scribe, to write messages on papyrus rolls that were sent to a kind of network of contacts. These people, in turn, copied his text, added their own comments and passed it on. ""Today we have computers and broadband, but the Romans had slaves and scribes who transmitted their messages,"" Standage told BBC Brasil. ""Members of the Roman elite wrote to each other constantly, commenting on the latest political developments and expressing opinions."" In addition to papyrus, another platform commonly used by the Romans was a wax tablet the size and shape of a modern tablet, on which they wrote messages, questions or transmitted the main points of the daily minutes, a ""newspaper"" displayed daily in the Forum of Rome. This tablet, the ""iPad of Ancient Rome"", was carried by a messenger to the recipient, who replied underneath the message. The article compares ancient and current communication technologies. With regard to the message genre, the following characteristics have endured throughout the ages",immediacy of responses.,information sharing.,direct interference by others in the original text.,recurrence of its use among members of the elite.,social profile of those involved in the communicative exchange.,2017,6,LC,B,english
QUESTION 07,"The secret cause Machado de Assis Garcia had approached the corpse, raised his handkerchief and gazed for a few moments at the dead features. Then, as if death had spiritualized everything, he bent down and kissed her on the forehead. It was at that moment that Fortunato arrived at the door. He stood stunned; it couldn't be the kiss of friendship, it could be the epilogue of an adulterous book [...]. In the meantime, Garcia leaned over to kiss the corpse again, but then he couldn't do it. The kiss broke into sobs, and his eyes couldn't hold back the tears, which came in torrents, tears of silent love and hopeless despair. Fortunato, at the door where she had stood, calmly savored this explosion of moral pain, which was long, very long, deliciously long. In the fragment, the narrator adopts a point of view that follows Fortunato's perspective. What distinguishes this narrative procedure is the register of the",indignation at the suspicion of his wife's adultery.,shared sadness at the loss of a beloved woman.,astonishment at Garcia's display of affection.,the character's pleasure in the suffering of others.,overcoming jealousy through the emotion resulting from the death.,2017,7,LC,D,english
QUESTION 08,"But as soon as we enter the universe of the web, we discover that it is not only an immense ""territory"" that is expanding rapidly, but that it also offers countless ""maps"", filters, selections to help the navigator find their way around. The best guide to the web is the web itself. Even if you have to have the patience to explore it. Even if you have to risk getting lost, accept ""the loss of time"" to familiarize yourself with this strange land. You may have to give in to its playful aspect for a moment in order to discover the sites that are closest to your professional interests or passions, and which can therefore nourish your personal journey in the best possible way. The novice user often feels disoriented in the ocean of information and possibilities available on the World Wide Web. In this sense, Pierre Lévy highlights the following as one of the main aspects of the Internet",open space for learning.,a large number of search tools.,no maps or explanatory guides.,infinite number of virtual pages.,Difficulty accessing research sites.,2017,8,LC,A,english
QUESTION 09,"TEXT I Terezinha de Jesus From a fall she went to the groundHelped three gentlemen All three with their hats in their hands The first was her father The second, her brotherThe third was the one to whom Tereza gave her hand TEXT II Another interpretation is based on the social conditions of the time. For the nanny and the child to whom the song was sung, the song spoke of marriage as a natural destiny in a woman's life in 19th century Brazilian society, marked by patriarchy. The song prepares the girl for her not only inexorable, but desirable destiny: marriage, establishing a hierarchy of obedience (father, older brother, husband), according to the time and circumstances of her life. Text II's comment on Text I evokes the mobilization of oral language which, in certain contexts,",ensures the existence of thoughts contrary to the prevailing order.,maintains the heterogeneity of the forms of social relations.,retains its religious influence on certain cultures.,preserves cultural and behavioral diversity.,reinforces cultural behaviors and patterns.,2017,9,LC,E,english
QUESTION 10,"Childhood Graciliano Ramos These girls had a habit of saying the opposite of what they wanted. I noticed the oddity when they started praising my monkey-colored jacket. They examined it seriously, found the cloth and the trims to be of superior quality, the shape admirable. I was thrilled: I had never noticed such advantages. But the bragging went on and on, making me suspicious. In the end, I realized that they were mocking me and I didn't get suspicious. Far from it: I found their way of talking funny, different from the rudeness I was used to. They usually told me frankly that my clothes didn't fit my body, they were too tight in my armpits. Through linguistic resources, texts mobilize strategies to introduce and return to ideas, promoting the progression of the theme. In the transcribed fragment, a new aspect of the theme is introduced by the expression","""the singularity"".","""those vantagens"".","""os gabos"".","""Far from it.""","""In general.""",2017,10,LC,D,english
QUESTION 11,"Description of the diagram: In the center of the diagram, the image of a stylized man, identiﬁed as the ""New Social Consumer"".

QUESTION 12,"The Tupi language in Brazil 300 years ago, living in the town of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the town, only two knew Portuguese. That's why, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew ""the general language of the Indians"", because ""those people can't be explained in any other language"". Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the São Paulo Mamelukes: the bandeiras, expeditions into the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes didn't even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the Bishop of Pernambuco as ""a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak"". In their wanderings, these people named places like Avanhandava (a place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (a place to make fishhooks) and Itu (a waterfall). And he ended up inventing a new language. ""The bandeirantes' slaves came from over 100 different tribes,"" says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. ""This changed São Paulo's Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages."" The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi. The text deals with socio-historical aspects of national linguistic formation. With regard to the role of Tupi in the formation of Brazilian Portuguese, it appears that this indigenous language","effectively contributed to the lexicon, with names relating to the characteristic features of the designated places.","originated the Portuguese spoken in São Paulo in the seventeenth century, whose grammatical basis also includes the speech of various indigenous ethnic groups.",developed under the influence of the catechetical work of the Portuguese priests who came from Lisbon.,It was mixed with African languages as a result of the interactions between the Portuguese and blacks during the attacks on the Quilombo dos Palmares.,"expanded in parallel with the Portuguese spoken by the colonizer, and together they gave rise to the language of the São Paulo bandeirantes.",2017,12,LC,A,english

QUESTION 14,"PROPAGANDA - An examination of the texts and messages of Propaganda reveals that it presents partial positions, which only reflect the thinking of a minority, as if they were instead expressing the conviction of a population; in essence, it is a question of convincing the listener or reader that, in terms of opinion, they are off the right track, and of inducing them to adhere to the theses presented to them, through a mechanism well known to social psychology, that of conformism induced by group pressures on the isolated individual. According to the text, the argumentative strategies and the use of language in the production of propaganda favor the",society's reflection on the products advertised.,dissemination of the thoughts and preferences of the masses.,imposition of the ideas and positions of specific groups.,the consumer's conscious decision regarding their purchase.,identiﬁcation of the interests of the person responsible for the disclosed product.,2017,14,LC,C,english

QUESTION 16,"TEXT I Creativity in advertising: theories and reflections Abstract: This article deals with a key issue in advertising: creativity. Although acclaimed by the creative departments of agencies, we must be aware that not every advertisement is, in fact, creative. The aim is to establish an understanding of the issues based on a theoretical review, in which the concepts are dealt with in the light of advertising. To elucidate these issues, a print campaign for the XXXX brand is analyzed. The reflections show that creative advertising is essentially simple and presents a reinterpretation of everyday life. TEXT II Image description: On a poster, the following phrase appears: ""Nobody knows creation better than them. May 13th - Mother's Day"". The two texts presented deal with the theme of creativity. Text I is a scientific summary and Text II is a tribute promoted by an advertising website.

QUESTION 17,"Texts and hypertexts: striking a balance There is a fear on the part of parents and some teachers that children will unlearn when they surf, that they will become addicted, that they will obtain unreliable information, that they will isolate themselves from the real world, as if the computer were an agent of evil, a villain. This fear is reinforced by the media, which often presents the computer as a negative agent in the learning and socialization of users. We know that no one runs the risk of unlearning when browsing, whether in digital environments or in printed materials, but it is necessary to see what is being learned and sometimes interfere in this process in order to optimize or guide learning, showing users other topics, other paths, other possibilities than those they have found on their own or those they usually use. Sometimes it is necessary to negotiate use so that it is not exclusive, since there are other means of communication, other means of information and other leisure alternatives. It's a question of balance, not blame. The author encourages the use of the internet by students, but ponders the need for guidance on its use, because this technology",is full of reliable information that is a unique source for students' learning.,requires parents and teachers to prohibit its abusive use to prevent it from becoming an addiction.,tends to become a negative agent in the learning and socialization of children and young people.,enables greater expansion of world knowledge when learning is targeted.,leads to isolation from the real world and exclusive use of the computer if browsing is excessive.,2017,17,LC,D,english
QUESTION 18,"The world revived Hindemburgo Dobal About this house and the trees that time forgot to take away. About the corral of stone and peace and other sad cows crying at the moon and the night without calves. Over the wide wall of this dam where other green snakes crawled, and the sun set in their still eyes as they harvested their crop of frogs. Under the southern constellations that the night armed and disarmed: the Three Marys, the distant Cross and the Seven Star. Over this world relived in vain, the memory of cousins, of horses, of silence lost forever. In the process of reconstituting the time lived, the lyrical self projects a set of images whose lyricism is based on",inventory of affectively evoked memories.,a reflection of nostalgia in the desire to return to childhood.,feeling of inadequacy with the present.,resentment at the material and human losses.,lapse in the temporal flow of the events brought to the scene.,2017,18,LC,A,english
QUESTION 19,"Social ascension through sport stirs people's imaginations, because in a few years a teenager can become a millionaire if they perform well in sport. Many boys from poor families play with the aim of earning money to provide a good quality of life for their families. This has brought soccer even closer to the poorer sections of society, making it increasingly popular. These youngsters dream of fame and money and see soccer as the only possible path to success. However, they are unaware of the great difficulty that exists at the beginning of this journey in which the minority achieve a professional career. These kids leave school for the illusion of winning at soccer, which the majority succumb to.  The road to professionalism is paved by a long selection process that young people have to go through. If they are not selected, they may have to abandon their career involuntarily for lack of a team to take them in. Some may end up underemployed, on the margins of society, or even addicted to this failure and disillusionment. This happens because, at the height of their schooling and in their youthful development, they are not prepared or properly guided to seek alternatives for broader occupational experiences outside and beyond soccer. In addressing the fact that, in Brazil, many young people place their hopes for the future in soccer, the text criticizes the following",unpreparedness of soccer players to help their families overcome poverty.,a guarantee of social advancement for young people through a career as a footballer.,lack of investment from clubs so that players can work professionally and make a living from soccer.,"reduced investment by professional athletes in their schooling, generating frustration and professional disillusionment in sport.","the subjects' lack of concern for an education parallel to sport, to enable them to work in other sectors of life.",2017,19,LC,E,english
QUESTION 20,"Declaration of love This is a declaration of love: I love the Portuguese language. It's not easy. It's not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is a real challenge for those who write. Especially for those who write to strip things and people of their first coat of superﬁcialism. Sometimes she reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes she's startled by the unpredictability of a sentence. I like to handle it - like I liked to ride a horse and lead it by the reins, sometimes at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to be in my hands as much as possible. And everyone who writes has this desire. Camões and others like him weren't enough to give us an inheritance of a language that was already made. All of us who write are making the tomb of thought into something that gives it life. We have these difficulties. But I haven't talked about the enchantment of dealing with a language that hasn't been explored in depth. What I've inherited isn't enough for me. If I were mute and couldn't write either, and you asked me which language I wanted to speak, I'd say English, which is precise and beautiful. But since I wasn't born mute and could write, it became absolutely clear to me that I really wanted to write in Portuguese. I even wish I hadn't learned other languages: just so that my approach to Portuguese would be virgin and limpid. The passage in which Clarice Lispector declares her love for the Portuguese language, emphasizing its patrimonial character and its capacity for renewal, is:","""The Portuguese language is a real challenge for anyone who writes.""","""One Camões and others like him weren't enough to give us a heritage of a language that was already made.""","""All of us who write are making the tomb of thought into something that gives it life.""","""But I haven't talked about the enchantment of dealing with a language that hasn't been explored in depth.""","""I even wish I hadn't learned other languages: just so that my approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.""",2017,20,LC,B,english
QUESTION 21,"TEXT I Description of the print: Untitled print by Oswaldo Goeldi, 1940. In the foreground, two skulls. One of them is sitting on the ground, covered in a thick cloak and wearing a beret. Behind it, there is a flag lying on the ground, made from a piece of wood and a simple cloth that looks like a floor cloth.

QUESTION 22,"TEXT I The Ticuna language is the most widely spoken among Brazil's indigenous people. According to researcher Aryon Rodrigues, there are 40,000 Indians who speak the language. Most of them live along the Solimões River, in the Upper Amazon. It is the largest indigenous nation in Brazil and is also found in Peru and Colombia. The Ticunas speak a language considered isolated, which bears no resemblance to any other indigenous language and is complex in its phonology and syntax. Its main characteristic is the use of different pitches in the voice. The intensive use of the language is not threatened by the proximity of cities or even by living with speakers of other languages within the Ticuna area itself: in the villages, these other speakers are a minority and end up submitting to the Ticuna reality, which is perhaps why they do not represent a linguistic threat. TEXT II Richness of the language ""English is destined to be a world language in a broader sense than Latin was in the past and French is in the present,"" said American president John Adams in the 18th century. The prophecy has come true: English is now the lingua franca of globalization. At the opposite end of the world's linguistic economy are the languages of small, declining communities. It is estimated that between 6,000 and 7,000 languages are spoken around the world today. Almost half of them are expected to disappear in the next 100 years. The latest edition of Ethnologue - the most comprehensive study of the world's languages - from 2005 listed 516 languages at risk of extinction. The texts deal with languages from completely different cultures, whose realities are similar due to the following",similarity in expansion mode.,preference for use in the spoken modality.,the way syntactic rules are organized.,predominance over other contact languages.,the fact that they lead to the disappearance of minority languages.,2017,22,LC,D,english

QUESTION 24,"And here, before continuing this show, we need to warn each and every one of you. At this point, we think it's essential that everyone takes a defined position. Without everyone taking a clear position, we can't continue. It's essential that everyone takes a position, whether to the left or to the right. We even allow some people to take a neutral stance, to stand with their arms crossed. But once everyone has taken their position, they have to stick to it! Otherwise, comrades, the theater seats creak a lot and nobody hears a thing. The play Liberdade, Liberdade , staged in 1964, presents the impasse experienced by Brazilian society in the face of the current regime. This impasse is represented in the fragment by",excessive noise produced by the creaking of the theater seats.,neutrality as the best ideological option at the time.,censorship in function of the social engagement of the dramatic text.,correlation between political alignment and the spectators' body position.,interruption of the show due to inappropriate public behavior.,2017,24,LC,D,english
QUESTION 25,"One night in 67 , by Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil. Editora Planeta, 296 pages. But it was one night, that Saturday night on October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. It stopped to watch the finale of the 3rd Record Festival, when a young man of 24 called Eduardo Lobo, or Edu Lobo, walked out of the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio , which he sang accompanied by the charming and novice Marília Medalha. It was on that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva with the MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. It was there that Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes. That night, which ended up becoming a movie in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being released now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who have seen the movie will be delighted with the stories - and some gossip - that each person has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie requires. And those who haven't seen the movie will have before them a book of stories, well, of history. Considering the constitutive elements of the textual genres circulating in society, this fragment of a review is dominated by",characterizations of personalities from the Brazilian music scene of the 1960s.,polemical issues related to Brazilian music production in the 1960s.,artists' experiences of the 1967 music festivals.,explanations of Brazil's cultural framework during the 1960s.,opinions on a piece about the 1967 music scene.,2017,25,LC,E,english
QUESTION 26,"Although many children and teenagers look up to Barbie as an example of beauty, an infographic made by the website Rehabs.com has shown that if a woman had the measurements of the plastic doll, she wouldn't even be alive. It's not exactly news that the proportions of the world's most famous doll are absurd for the real world. Activists fighting to build a healthier self-image, eating disorder researchers and people concerned about the impact of the culture industry on the human psyche have been pointing out for years the influence of models like Barbie in distorting the female body. Neck With a neck twice as long and 15 centimetres thinner than a woman's, Barbie would be unable to hold her head up. Waist With a waist of 40 centimeters (smaller than her head), the real-life Barbie would only have room in her body to accommodate half a kidney and a few centimeters of intestine. Hips Barbie's waist-to-hip ratio is 0.56, which means that her waist measurement represents 56% of her hip circumference. This same index is 0.8 for the average American woman. In addressing the possible influences of the toy industry on the representation of the female body, the text analyzes the",notion of globalized beauty conveyed by the culture industry.,the influence of the media on women's adoption of a healthy lifestyle.,the relationship between healthy eating and the body standard established by the doll.,proportionality between the representation of the doll's body and that of the human body.,marketing influence on the construction of a positive self-image of the female body.,2017,26,LC,D,english

QUESTION 29,"TEXT I The rules of Normative Grammar are based on the works of the great writers, in whose language the enlightened classes place their ideal of perfection, because it is there that they mirror what idiomatic usage has stabilized and enshrined. TEXT II Book of Disquiet Fernando Pessoa I like to say. I'll say it better: I like to talk. For me, words are touchable bodies, visible sirens, embodied sensualities. Perhaps because real sensuality is of no interest to me whatsoever - not even mental or dreamlike - my desire has transmuted into that which creates verbal rhythms in me, or hears them from others. I shudder if they say it right. Such a page by Fialho, such a page by Chateaubriand, makes my whole life tingle in all my veins, makes me tremulously rage quietly at the unattainable pleasure I'm experiencing. Even such a page by Vieira, in its cold perfection of syntactic engineering, makes me tremble like a branch in the wind, in a passive delirium of something moved.

QUESTION 31,"In sport-participation or popular sport, the manifestation occurs on the principle of playful pleasure, whose purpose is the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time, and takes place in spaces that are not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life. Its aims are relaxation, fun, personal development and relationships with people. It can be argued that sport-participation, being the social dimension of sport most interrelated with democratic paths, balances out the inequality of sporting opportunities found in the sport-performance dimension. While performance sport only allows success for the talented or those who have the means, participation sport favors pleasure for all who wish to take part. The sense of sport-participation constructed in the text is fundamentally present in","in the Olympic Games, since they bring together different countries to compete in different sports.","in individual sports competitions, since the success of one individual encourages the participation of others.","in the official regional and national soccer championships, as it is a very popular sport in the country.","in competitions promoted by federations and confederations, the aim of which is to train and discover talent.","in adapted sports, the aim of which is to get citizens more involved.",2017,31,LC,E,english

QUESTION 35,"At three o'clock in the afternoon Raduan Nassar In this room cluttered with tables, machines and papers, where enviable scribes have shared the good sense of the world, applying themselves to clear ideas despite the noise and the dreariness, confident in their pronouncements on problems that afflict modern man (a species from which you, millennially tired, perhaps feel somewhat excluded), suddenly drop everything under the gaze of the people around you, put on the face of a quiet and dangerous madman, make the calmest gestures like the sternest scribes, give a broad ""ciao"" to the day's work, just like someone saying goodbye to life, and surprise a little later, with your presence at such an unusual time, those who were at home busy cleaning out the cupboards, which you didn't know how to do before. It's a good idea not to answer their questioning looks, but to let the intense expectation build up for a moment. But don't overdo it and go up to the bedroom without delay, freeing your feet from socks and shoes, taking off your clothes as if you were removing the importance of things, then putting on minimal clothing, perhaps even fur, but without hurting your decorum (your decorum, of course), and at the same time accepting every change in behavior as a good provisional truth.

QUESTION 38,"Marcos Guião That morning, with clear skies and light air, due to the torrential rain of the night before, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to get a feel for the first stirrings of life on the farm. It didn't take me long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made my hunger wake up from the lethargy of a long night's sleep. I took my hands to the water flowing from the bamboo spout and the icy contact was chilling. But I went ahead and cupped my hands to my face. With the impact, I recoiled and was out of breath for a few moments, but I woke up immediately. Already alight, I went into the kitchen in an attempt to quell my hunger and get closer to the warmth of the wood-burning stove. That's when I noticed the slender, discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy who looked about five years old, already perched on the edge of the table in intimate conversation with the owner of the house. After a vigorous ""Good morning!"" and a steamy handshake in the usual introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Adão for treatment of the sores that were popping up all over his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.

The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this song, which made Neusa's hair stand on end, he began with a waltz that was even harder, full of difficult words, but as beautiful as a serene drop. It was the story of an enchanting doll seen in a crystal showcase on a superb pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let out his voice: Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ Full rays of love./ Her eyes were circumvallate/ Of the blue romanticism of the lakes/ Lirious hands, divine arms,/ A matchless target body/ And very small feet./ At last I saw in this doll/ A perfect Venus.

QUESTION 40,"Milton Hatoum The laundress began to live as a servant who commands respect, and no longer as a slave. But this sudden perk was short-lived.

A kind of disgust tinged their faces, they no longer ate with the same satiety and refused to praise the lamb mince pastries, the cream and date veneers, and the almond rice, golden and smelling of toasted onions. That woman, seated and mute, her face streaked with wrinkles, was capable of taking away the taste and smell of the food and suppressing her voice and gesture, as if her silence or her presence, which was only silence, prevented the other person from living.

QUESTION 45,"TEXT I TEXT II Image description: Work by Robert Rauschenberg, entitled Bed, from 1955. The work consists of a bed hanging vertically on the wall, with all its characteristic elements: pillow, sheets and bedspread. A sheet is pulled up, as if ready to receive a person. In the upper part of the work, where the pillow is, there are many spots of paint, placed almost randomly. A large part of these thick layers of paint have dripped onto the central part of the bed. In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg (b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his new works that had aspects of both painting and sculpture. In 1958, Cama was selected to be included in an exhibition of young American and Italian artists at the Festival of the Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. Those in charge of the festival, however, refused to exhibit the work and removed it to storage. Although the art world debated the innovation of hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg considered his work ""one of the most welcoming pictures I've ever painted, but I was always afraid that someone would want to get into it"". Rauschenberg's work shocked the public at the time it was made, and was strongly influenced by an artistic movement that was characterized by the","dissolution of tones and contours, revealing rapid production.","unusual exploration of everyday elements, dialoguing with ready-mades.","exhaustive repetition of visual elements, leading to maximum simplification of the composition.","incorporation of technological transformations, valuing the dynamism of modern life.","geometrization of forms, diluting details without worrying about fidelity to reality.",2017,45,LC,B,english
