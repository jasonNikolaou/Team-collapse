QUESTION 46,"At the Second International Congress of Geographical Sciences in 1875, which was attended by the President of the Republic, the Governor of Paris and the President of the Assembly, Admiral La Roucière-Le Noury's inaugural speech set out the prevailing attitude at the meeting: ""Gentlemen, Providence has dictated to us the obligation to know and conquer the earth. This supreme order is one of the imperative duties inscribed in our intelligences and our activities. Geography, that science which inspires such beautiful devotion and in whose name so many victims have been sacrificed, has become the philosophy of the earth."" In the historical context presented, the exaltation of geographical science stems from its use for",cultural preservation of occupied territories.,humanitarian formation of European society.,cataloging data useful for colonialist purposes.,development of mathematical techniques for constructing charts.,consolidation of topographical knowledge as an academic field.,2018,46,CH,C,english
QUESTION 47,"The Knights of Christ The existence of a hospital in Jerusalem for the accommodation and care of pilgrims, as well as those among them who were tired or ill, strengthened the link between the work of assistance and charity and the Holy Land. By making the Jerusalem Hospital a central establishment of the order in 1113, Paschal II encouraged the affiliation of the hospitalaries of the West to it, especially those who were linked to pilgrimages in the Holy Land or elsewhere. The militarization of the Jerusalem Hospital did not diminish its original charitable vocation, but rather strengthened it. The event described is linked to the Western phenomenon of","the rise of warrior monasticism, brought about by the crusades.","decentralization of ecclesiastical power, produced by feudalism.","the spread of bubonic plague, caused by commercial expansion.","affirmation of the mendicant fraternity, stimulated by spiritual reform.","creation of medical schools, promoted by the urban renaissance.",2018,47,CH,A,english
QUESTION 48,"In the work Society against the State, Pierre Clastres writes: The tribe does not have a king, but a chief who is not the head of state. What does this mean? Simply that the chief has no authority, no power of coercion, no means of giving an order. The chief is not a commander, the people of the tribe have no duty of obedience. The space of the chief is not the place of power. Essentially in charge of eliminating conflicts that can arise between individuals, families and lineages, the chief only has the prestige that society recognizes in order to restore order and concord. But prestige obviously doesn't mean power, and the chief's means of carrying out his task as peacemaker are limited to the exclusive use of words. The political model of the societies discussed in the text contrasts with that of the liberal bourgeois state because it is based on:",Ideological imposition and hierarchical norms.,Divine determination and monarchical sovereignty.,Consensual intervention and community autonomy.,Legal mediation and contractual rules.,Collective management and tax obligations.,2018,48,CH,C,english
QUESTION 49,"In Praise of Philosophy, Merleau-Ponty writes: The philosopher recognizes himself by the inseparable possession of the taste for evidence and the sense of ambiguity. When he merely endures ambiguity, it is called equivocation. It has always been the case that even those who claimed to build an absolutely positive philosophy were only able to be philosophers insofar as they simultaneously refused the right to settle in absolute knowledge. What characterizes the philosopher is the movement that leads incessantly from knowledge to ignorance, from ignorance to knowledge, and a certain rest in this movement. The text presents an understanding of the constitutive elements of the philosopher's activity, which is characterized by",bringing together the antagonisms of opinion with the dialectical method.,adjusting the clarity of knowledge to the innatism of ideas.,associating the certainty of the intellect with the immutability of truth.,reconciling the rigor of research with the restlessness of questioning.,making thought structures compatible with fundamental principles.,2018,49,CH,D,english
QUESTION 50,"This bus is related to the act carried out in 1955 by Rosa Parks, shown in a photograph alongside Martin Luther King. The vehicle has achieved the status of a museum piece because it symbolizes the",impact of the fear of the arms race.,democratization of access to public schools.,gender bias in public transport.,outbreak of the movement for civil equality.,Rebellion breaks out in youth behavior.,2018,50,CH,D,english
QUESTION 51,"In the Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas writes: Provided we have understood the meaning of the word ""God"", we know at once that God exists. In fact, this word designates something of such a nature that we cannot conceive of anything greater than it. Now, what exists in reality and in thought is greater than what exists only in thought. Hence it follows that the object designated by the word ""God"", which exists in thought, as long as we understand that word, also exists in reality. Therefore, the existence of God is evident. The text presents a theoretical elaboration by Thomas Aquinas characterized by",to reiterate religious orthodoxy against heretics.,to rationally support doctrine based on faith.,explain the theological virtues by demonstration.,making the official interpretation of sacred texts more flexible.,pragm atically justifying dogma-free belief.,2018,51,CH,B,english
QUESTION 52,"TEXT I In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes writes: All that is valid for a time of war, in which every man is the enemy of every man, is valid also for the time during which men live with no other security than that which can be offered to them by their own strength and invention. TEXT II In Discourse on the origin and foundation of inequality between men, Jean-Jacques Rousseau writes: Let us not conclude with Hobbes that, because man has no idea of goodness, he is naturally evil. This author should say that, since the state of nature is the one in which the care for our own conservation is least harmful to that of others, this state was therefore the most suitable for peace and the most convenient for the human race. The excerpts present conceptual divergences between authors who support an understanding according to which equality between men occurs because of a",predisposition to knowledge.,submission to the transcendent.,epistemological tradition.,original condition.,political vocation.,2018,52,CH,D,english
QUESTION 53,"Globalization as reterritorialization Gone are the days when it was possible to show an economic world organized in well-defined layers, where large urban centers linked themselves to adjacent ""slow"" economies, with the much faster pace of far-reaching trade and finance. Today, everything happens as if these overlapping layers were intermingled and interpermeated. Short- and long-range interdependencies can no longer be separated from each other. The greater complexity of contemporary urban spaces highlighted in the text is explained by",expansion of metropolitan areas.,emancipation of new municipalities.,consolidation of legal domains.,articulation of multi-scalar networks.,redefinition of administrative regions Description of Figure 1: Photograph of an old bus on display in a museum. Description of Figure 2: Photograph in which Rosa Parks stands next to Martin Luther King.,2018,53,CH,D,english
QUESTION 54,"TEXT I Demonology and colonization: 16th-18th centuries And since I cannot take revenge on the devil in any other way in this part, I warn everyone who reads this place, from the cross of Christ Jesus, to give this land the name that was so solemnly given to it, under penalty of the same cross that will be shown to us on the final day, accusing them of being more devoted to brazilwood than to it. TEXT II Everyday life and private life in Portuguese America And this is how the settlers are, who, no matter how rooted they are in the land and how rich they are, want to take everything to Portugal, and if the estates and goods they possess have taught them to speak, they have also taught them to speak like parrots, to whom the first thing they teach is: real parrot for Portugal, because they want everything there. These chroniclers' criticisms of the Portuguese colonization process in America were related to the",use of slave labor.,establishment of urban centers.,devastation of natural areas.,occupation of indigenous lands.,expropriation of local wealth.,2018,54,CH,E,english
QUESTION 55,"Cuba and the Russians The Soviets had arrived in Cuba very early in the 1960s, sneaking in through the gap opened by the immediate US hostility towards the social revolutionary process. For three decades the Soviets maintained their presence in Cuba with bases and military aid, but above all with all the economic support that, as we would learn years later, kept the country afloat, although it left us in debt to the Soviet brothers - and then to their Russian heirs - for figures that reached 32 billion dollars. In other words, what was offered in the name of socialist solidarity had a definite price. The text indicates that during the Cold War, internal relations within the same bloc were marked by",pursuit of political neutrality.,stimulating commercial competition.,subordination to the hegemonic power.,elasticity of geographical borders.,sharing scientific research.,2018,55,CH,C,english
QUESTION 56,"Geography of wealth, hunger and the environment Hunger is not a technical problem, as it is not due to a lack of food, because hunger today coexists with the material conditions to solve it. The text shows that the food problem presented has a political dimension because it is associated with",regional productivity scale.,pattern of income distribution.,difficulty in storing grains.,world population growth.,cost of disposing of products.,2018,56,CH,B,english
QUESTION 57,"The poet Emília Freitas took to the stage nervously, apologizing for not having any titles or knowledge, but proudly offering her pen, which ""without being skillful, is, on the other hand, guided by the power of the will"". Maria Tomásia pronounced prayers that lifted her listeners. The writer Francisca Clotilde captivated with her poems. These ""angelic ladies"", ""heroines of charity"", raised money to buy freedoms and used their enthusiasm to convince slave owners to grant them free freedoms. The cultural practices narrated refer historically to the movement",feminist.,suffragette.,socialist.,republicano.,abolitionist.,2018,57,CH,E,english
QUESTION 58,"President João Goulart's speech at the Central do Brasil rally The democracy they want is the democracy of privilege, the democracy of intolerance and hatred. The democracy they want is to liquidate Petrobras, it's the democracy of the monopolies, national and international, the democracy that could fight against the people. Just yesterday I said that democracy could never be threatened by the people, when the people freely come to the squares - the squares that belong to the people. To the streets - which belong to the people. At a time of political radicalization, the rhetoric in President João Goulart's speech, delivered at the Central do Brasil rally, sought to justify the need to",contain the economic opening in order to win the support of the elites.,prevent external interference to guarantee the preservation of rights.,regulating the media to curb opposition parties.,to approve the reformist projects in response to the mobilization of labor sectors.,increase the privatization process to reduce the pressure of public opinion.,2018,58,CH,D,english
QUESTION 59,"Declared war and feigned peace in the Portuguese restoration The Portuguese-Brazilian rebellion in Pernambuco began in 1644 and exploded on June 13, 1645, the day of Saint Anthony. One of João Fernandes' first measures was to declare the rebels' debts to the Dutch null and void. There was great support from the ""nobility of the land"", who were enthusiastic about this heroic proclamation. The outbreak of this revolt in 17th century Portuguese America was the result of",the warlike weakness of the Batavian Protestants.,West African transatlantic trade.,financial aid from Flemish traders.,international diplomacy two Iberian States.,economic interests of the plantation owners.,2018,59,CH,E,english
QUESTION 60,"Who really welcomes refugees? In Beirut, Lebanon, when asked where the Syrian refugees are, the man's answer is immediate: ""everywhere and nowhere"". Walking at random, it's not uncommon to see, under a building or in a corner of a sidewalk, sheltered from the wind, a refugee family around a frugal meal laid out on newspapers as if they were napkins. Every now and then you see a tent with the acronym UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) erected on one of the capital's rare vacant lots. The scenario described points to a humanitarian crisis that is explained by the process of",mass migration of people affected by a natural disaster.,cultural hybridization of groups characterized by social homogeneity.,voluntary demobilization of militants co-opted by extremist sects.,religious pilgrimage of believers guided by fundamentalist leaders.,forced de-territorialization of populations affected by armed conflicts.,2018,60,CH,E,english
QUESTION 61,"TEXT I Program of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) Foreign capital It is essential to maintain a climate conducive to the entry of foreign capital. Maintaining this climate recommends the adoption of disciplinary rules for investments and their income, with a view to retaining in the country the largest possible share of the profits made. TEXT II Program of the National Democratic Union (UDN) Capital Appeal to foreign capital, which is necessary for national reconstruction projects and, above all, for the exploitation of our untapped reserves, giving it fair treatment and freedom to withdraw interest. Considering the 1950s and 1960s in Brazil, the excerpts from the PSD and UDN programs converged in defense of",autonomy of action for multinationals.,decentralization of tax collection.,flexibilization of foreign exchange reserves.,freedom to remit earnings.,raising funds from abroad.,2018,61,CH,E,english
QUESTION 62,"Israel: the coming crisis Israel's demographic situation is very particular. Since 1967, the Zionist left has claimed that Israel should quickly get rid of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, arguing from a seemingly inexorable demographic logic. Because the Arab birth rate is much higher, the annexation of the Palestinian territories, formal or informal, would result in an Arab majority ""between the river and the sea"" within one or two generations. The concern presented in the text reveals an aspect of the political conduct of this state identified with",Abdication of military interference in local conflicts.,pursuit of ethnic pre-eminence over the national space.,admission of proactive participation in regional blocs.,breaking with the geopolitical interests of the global powers.,commitment to the resolutions issued by international organizations.,2018,62,CH,B,english
QUESTION 63,Which characteristic of the physical environment is a necessary condition for the spatial distribution of the phenomenon represented?,Tree cover.,Orographic barriers with high altitudes.,A marked difference in atmospheric pressure.,Continental surface with intense reflectivity.,Marine currents with converging directions.,2018,63,CH,C,english
QUESTION 64,"Spells and sorcerers Another important manifestation of African beliefs and traditions in the colony were the objects known as ""mandinga bags"". Physical and spiritual insecurity generated a widespread need for protection: from natural disasters, illnesses, bad luck, violence in urban centers, robberies, fights, the evils of sorcerers, etc. The custom was also common in the first decades of the 18th century, involving not only slaves but also white men, to bring luck, money and even attract women. The historical and cultural practice of African origin described in the text represented one of the following",an expression of the value of the poor people's festivities.,tool for subjecting captives to forced labor.,strategy to subvert the power of the Portuguese monarchy.,element of converting slaves to Roman Catholicism.,"instrument to minimize the feeling of social helplessness. Image description: World map titled Trajectory of tropical cyclones indicating greater concentration of cyclones in the tropical zone over the Pacific, Indian and North Atlantic oceans.",2018,64,CH,E,english
QUESTION 65,"Ports in the context of the technical environment Ports have always been a response to high-volume trade, which takes place by sea, lake and river, and have been adapted or modernized according to a set of factors that range from their privileged location in front of extensive hinterlands, to their connectivity with modern transport networks that guarantee accessibility, to the current state of technology, which makes them the spearhead of a globalized economy that compresses time in the name of productivity and competitiveness. One change that has allowed ports to adapt to the new commercial needs pointed out in the text has been the",increased use of containers.,compacting storage areas.,bureaucratization of customs services.,reducing the depth of the moorings.,overcoming the specialization of freighters.,2018,65,CH,A,english
QUESTION 66,"The 18th century was, for many reasons, a distinctive century. Reason and experimentation came together in what was believed to be the true path to establishing scientific knowledge, which had been longed for for so long. Fact, analysis and induction became fundamental partners of reason. It was still in the 18th century that man began to become aware of his situation in history. In the cultural environment of the Ancien Régime, the philosophical discussion mentioned in the text had as one of its characteristics the",bringing innovation and ancient knowledge closer together.,reconciliation between revelation and Platonic metaphysics.,the link between scholasticism and research practices.,separation between theology and religious fundamentalism.,contrast between clericalism and freedom of thought.,2018,66,CH,E,english
QUESTION 67,"Image description : Graph showing the flow in two different types of cover, urbanized and non-urbanized. The vertical axis shows the volume of precipitation, in millimeters, and the horizontal axis shows the time, in hours. The rainfall in the first three hours is distributed as follows: hour 1: almost 60 millimeters; hour 2: more than 60 millimeters and hour 3: approximately 35 millimeters. The line referring to the Flow in urbanized areas evolves from 0 to 10 millimeters in hour 1, reaching its peak of more than 90 millimeters in hour 3 and then descending until it reaches 0 millimeters in hour 12, in approximate values. The line referring to flow in non-urbanized areas evolves from 0 to 5 millimeters at hour 1, peaking at 70 millimeters at hour 6 and then dropping to 0 millimeters at hour 15, in approximate values. The hydrological dynamics expressed in the graph show that the urbanization process promotes the",reduction in the volume of rivers.,expansion of the water table.,decrease in rainfall.,shrinking reservoir levels.,increased surface runoff.,2018,67,CH,E,english
QUESTION 68,"In The Conquest of America, Todorov writes: The encounter between the Old and New Worlds, which Columbus's discovery made possible, is of a very particular kind: it is a war - or the Conquest - as it was then called. And one mystery remains: the outcome of the battle. Why the blazing victory, if the inhabitants of America were so outnumbered by their opponents and fought on their own soil? If we limit ourselves to the conquest of Mexico - the most spectacular, since Mexican civilization is the most brilliant in the pre-Columbian world - how can we explain the fact that Cortez, leading hundreds of men, managed to take the kingdom of Montezuma, who had hundreds of thousands of warriors? In the context of the conquest, according to the analysis presented in the text, one strategy to overcome the disparities raised was",to implement Christian missions among the subjected communities.,use the physical superiority of the African mercenaries.,exploit the rivalries between the native peoples.,introduce vectors for the spread of epidemic diseases.,buying land to weaken the indigenous theocracies.,2018,68,CH,C,english
QUESTION 69,"Letter from cartoonist Henrique de Souza Filho, known as Henfil São Paulo, January 10, 1979. Considering the instructions given by Your Excellency to deny passports to Francisco Julião, Miguel Arraes, Leonel Brizola, Luis Prestes, Paulo Schilling, Gregório Bezerra, Márcio Moreira Alves and Paulo Freire. Considering that, since I was born, I have fully identified with the skin, hair color, culture, smile, aspirations, history and blood of these eight gentlemen.

QUESTION 70,"The society of the spectacle The first phase of the domination of the economy over social life led to a clear degradation in the way all human achievement is defined, from being to having. The current phase, in which social life is totally taken over by the results of the economy, leads to a generalized slide from having to seeming, from which every effective having must derive its immediate prestige and ultimate function.  At the same time, every individual reality has become social, directly dependent on the social force and shaped by it. A contemporary manifestation of the phenomenon described in the text is",valuing accumulated knowledge.,media exposure.,deeper spiritual experience.,strengthening interpersonal relationships.,recognition in the artistic sphere.,2018,70,CH,B,english
QUESTION 71,"1910: the sailors' revolt Their leaders were imprisoned and murdered. The rebel ""marujada"" was entirely expelled from the squadron. In a historical sense, however, they were victorious. The ""lash"" and other infamous physical punishments were never officially used again; from then on, the sailors - now respected - would have their living conditions significantly improved. They certainly moved history forward. The outbreak of this conflict was the result of the tension built up in the Brazilian Navy by",engagement of illiterate civilians after the outbreak of external wars.,the dissatisfaction of the positivist military after the consolidation of the governors' policy.,demotion of veteran commanders after the repression of millenarian insurrections.,uprising of the rural working classes after the introduction of compulsory conscription.,maintenance of the slave mentality of the officialdom after the fall of the imperial regime.,2018,71,CH,E,english
QUESTION 72,"Indigenous people were the first to alter the Amazon ecosystem Research carried out by Carolina Levis, an ecology specialist at the National Institute for Amazon Research, and published in the journal Science , shows that the plant species domesticated by pre-Columbian civilizations are the most dominant. ""The domestication of plants in the forest began more than 8,000 years ago. First, plants with characteristics that could be useful to man were selected and then these species were propagated. They began to cultivate them in courtyards and gardens through an almost intuitive process of selection."" The text takes a new look at the configuration of the Amazon Rainforest by breaking with the idea of",the primacy of local knowledge.,absence of anthropic action.,insufficient natural resources.,the need for environmental management.,predominantly agricultural practices.,2018,72,CH,B,english
QUESTION 73,"TEXT I In The Art of War, Sun Tzu writes: When an army crosses mountains, forests, precipice zones, or marches along gorges, marshes or swamps, or any other terrain where movement is arduous, it is in difficult terrain. Terrain where it is cramped and the way out is tortuous and where a small enemy force can attack mine, albeit a larger one, is surrounded. TEXT II The main objective was to find and kill Osama Bin Laden. Where is he hiding? We mustn't forget the difficulty of occupying the country, which has a mountainous terrain, full of caves, where it is easy for those who are used to this terrain to hide.

QUESTION 75,"Industrial countries have adopted a different conception of family relations and the place of fertility in family and social life.

QUESTION 78,"The initial milestone in parliamentary discussions around the right to vote for women are the debates that preceded the Constitution of 1824, which did not contain any impediment to women exercising their political rights, but which, on the other hand, was also not explicit about the possibility of doing so. It was only in 1932, two years before the right to vote was established at the age of 18, that women were granted the right to vote, which came to fruition the following year. This happened with the approval of the Electoral Code of 1932. One of the factors that contributed to the implementation of the measure mentioned in the text was the",overcoming patriarchal culture.,influence of Protestant churches.,pressure from the revolutionary government.,fragility of regional oligarchies.,citizenship outreach campaign.,2018,78,CH,E,english

QUESTION 80,"In some Mozambican languages there is no word for ""poor"". A person is poor when they have no relatives. Poverty is loneliness, the breakdown of family relationships which, in rural society, support survival. International consultants, who specialize in drawing up reports on poverty, perhaps don't take into account the dramatic impact of the destruction of family ties and mutual aid relationships.

In a reading that goes beyond the economic sphere, the writer Mia Couto associates the worsening of poverty with the",affirmation of ancestral origins.,weakening of social networks.,standardization of educational policies.,fragmentation of farms.,globalization of communication technologies.,2018,80,CH,B,english
QUESTION 81,"TEXT I Borders, while separating, unite and articulate, passing through them discourses legitimizing social order as much as conflict. TEXT II The latest barriers to the free movement of money and money-making goods and information go hand in hand with the pressure to dig new ditches and erect new walls to block the movement of those who, as a result, lose their roots, physically or spiritually. The contemporary re-signification of the idea of the border includes the",release of the movement of people.,preponderance of natural boundaries.,removal of customs barriers.,devaluation of the notion of nationalism.,selectivity of segregating mechanisms.,2018,81,CH,E,english
QUESTION 82,"TEXT I For more than two decades, scientists and environmentalists have been warning that fresh water is a scarce resource on our planet. Since the beginning of 2014, the southeast of Brazil has gained a clear perception of this reality as a result of the drought. TEXT II Image description: Conceptual diagram entitled Atmospheric dynamics in Brazil showing the elements relevant to moisture transport in South America east of the Andes, in two images, one for a normal summer and the other for the dry summer of 2014. In the image for a normal summer, the South Atlantic Convergence Zone is shown over the Southeast, resulting from the meeting of the Low Level Jets, which come from the Atlantic Ocean and pass through the Amazon, the Atlantic Ocean Flow, and the Cold Fronts coming from the South. In this situation, the area has moist soil. In the image for the summer of 2014, in the place where the Convergence Zone would occur in the Southeast, there is a center of high atmospheric pressure anomaly, represented in the image by circular arrows. Instead of being wet, the ground is dry. According to the information presented, the natural cause of the 2014 drought in the Southeast was the following",warm fronts blocking convective rainfall.,formation of an anticyclone preventing the entry of moisture.,presence of cloudiness in the cordillera region.,advance of polar masses towards the continent.,low atmospheric pressure on the coast.,2018,82,CH,B,english
QUESTION 83,"In Confessions, St. Augustine writes: Isn't it true that those who tell us, ""What was God doing before he created heaven and earth?"" are still full of spiritual old age? If he was idle and did nothing,"" they say, ""why hasn't he always remained so throughout the centuries, refraining, as before, from all action? If there existed in God a new movement, a new will to give being to creatures that he had never created before, how can there be true eternity if in him appears a will that did not exist before?"" The question of eternity, as addressed by the author, is an example of philosophical reflection on the",essence of Christian ethics.,universal nature of tradition.,unshakeable certainties of experience.,scope of human understanding.,interpretations of the surrounding reality.,2018,83,CH,D,english
QUESTION 84,"In Time and the Wind, Erico Verissimo writes: Rodrigo had been appointed by the opposition as an inspector at one of the polling stations. He put his revolver in his waistband, a box of bullets in his pocket and went to his post. The call for voters began at seven in the morning. Planted by the door, Trindade's henchmen offered ballots with the names of the official candidates to all the voters who entered. Almost all of them meekly took the papers and deposited them in the ballot box, after signing the authentic one. Those who refused to do so had their names painstakingly written down. Erico Verissimo's fictional work deals with the following characteristic aspect of political life during the First Republic:",Forced identification of illiterate men.,Legal monitoring of legislative processes.,Explicit repression of the exercise of rights.,Advertising aimed at the rural population.,Police clampdown on unionized workers.,2018,84,CH,C,english

QUESTION 86,"The national policy on agroecology and organic production in Brazil Ecological agriculture and organic food production are gaining prominence in different parts of the world. The same is happening in Brazil. Driven in particular by the expansion in demand for healthy food, the sector is growing every year, although it remains relatively marginalized on the agenda of agricultural policy priorities in the country.

The vertical axis corresponds to the percentage and the horizontal axis corresponds to the year. A line corresponding to plant extractivism indicates 60 percent in 1996, dropping to less than 50 percent in 1998, remaining at this level until 2002, dropping to less than 40 percent in 2003, continuing this trend until reaching just over 20 percent in 2014, in approximate figures. The line corresponding to Forestry indicates 40 percent in 1996, rising to just over 50 percent in 1998, remaining at this level until 2002, rising to just over 60 percent in 2003, continuing this trend until reaching almost 80 percent in 2014, in approximate figures. Visually, the lines start from the vertical axis apart, oscillating close together between 1997 and 2002, then following a downward trend until 2014, when they reversed their initial positions. The lines oppose each other symmetrically throughout the period recorded. Considering the differences between plant extractivism and forestry, the variation in the graph's curves was influenced by the trend of",conservation of the native biome.,stagnation in the primary sector.,use of reforested wood.,reduction in furniture production.,retraction of the food industry.,2018,88,CH,C,english
QUESTION 89,"In the early 1990s, two leading biologists, Redford and Robinson, produced a widely accepted model of ""sustainable production"" that predicted how many individuals of each species could be hunted sustainably based on their reproduction rates. The rubber tappers of the Upper Juruá had a different model: when people told them that they were hunting above what was sustainable (within the model), they said no, that the level of hunting depended on the existence of refuge areas where nobody hunted. This turned out to be the ""source-drain"" model proposed ten years after the first one by Novaro, Bodmer and Redford himself, and which supplanted the previous model. In the context of scientific production, the need to reconstruct this model, as set out in the text, was determined by the confrontation with one of the following",operational conclusion reached by deductive logic.,worldview marked by moral prejudices.,social habit conditioned by popular religiosity.,empirical knowledge appropriated by common sense.,preservation standard built by directed experimentation.,2018,89,CH,D,english
QUESTION 90,"In his General Theory of Politics, Norberto Bobbio writes: One of the theoreticians of modern democracy, Hans Kelsen, considers an essential element of real democracy (not ideal democracy, which does not exist anywhere) to be the method of selecting leaders, i.e. elections. An example of this is the statement made by a US Supreme Court judge during an election in 1902: ""The electoral booth is the temple of American institutions, where each one of us is a priest, entrusted with the care of the ark of the covenant and each one officiates from his own altar"". The metaphors used in the text refer to a conception of democracy based on",theistic justification of law.,rigidity of the class hierarchy.,formalist emphasis in administration.,the Executive's leading role in power.,centrality of the individual in society.,2018,90,CH,E,english
