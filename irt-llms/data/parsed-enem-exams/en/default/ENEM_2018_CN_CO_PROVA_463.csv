QUESTÃO 104,"German Fritz Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing a viable process for synthesizing ammonia (NH 3). In his award speech, Haber justified the importance of the achievement by saying that: ""Since the middle of the last century, it has become known that a supply of nitrogen is a basic necessity for increasing food crops; however, it was also known that plants cannot absorb nitrogen in its simple form, which is the main constituent of the atmosphere. They need nitrogen to be combined [...] in order to assimilate it. Agricultural economies basically keep the nitrogen balance on. However, with the advent of the industrial age, the products of the soil are taken from where the crop grows to distant places where they are consumed, so that the bound nitrogen does not return to the land from which it was taken. This has led to a worldwide economic need to supply the soil with bound nitrogen. [...] The demand for nitrogen, like that for coal, indicates how different our way of life has become from that of the people who, with their own bodies, fertilize the soil they cultivate. Since the middle of the last century, we had been taking advantage of the nitrogen supply from the saltpeter that nature had deposited in the mountainous deserts of Chile. Comparing the rapid growth in demand with the calculated extent of these deposits, it became clear that by the middle of the current century a very serious emergency would be inevitable unless chemistry found a way out."" According to Haber's arguments, what phenomenon would have caused the imbalance in the ""linked nitrogen balance""?",The depletion of Chile's saltpeter reserves.,The increase in charcoal and coal mining.,The reduction of soil fertility in agricultural economies.,The intensification of the flow of people from the countryside to the cities.,The need for plants to absorb nitrogen salts available in the soil.,2018,104,CN,D,english

Car A was assembled to simulate the situation in the cartoons, as the fan is directed towards the sail. The cardboard was installed on the right and the fan on the left in both cars. The students turned on the fans, waited for the air flow to become permanent and determined the moduli of the average speeds of cars A ( V A) and B ( V B ) for the same time interval. Regarding the intensities of the average speeds and the direction of movement of car A , the students observed that:", Car A's speed is zero; Car B's speed is greater than zero; Car A is not moving., Zero is less than the speed of car A and the speed of car A is less than the speed of car B; car A is moving to the right.,Zero is less than the speed of car A and the speed of car A is less than the speed of car B; car A moves to the left.,Zero is less than the speed of car B and the speed of car B is less than the speed of car A; car A is moving to the right.,Zero is less than the speed of car B and the speed of car B is less than the speed of car A; car A is moving to the left.,2018,131,CN,B,english
QUESTION 132,"Elements of nature and soil properties Proper soil management makes it possible to maintain soil fertility as nutrient exchanges between organic matter, water, soil and air are maintained to guarantee production. Some ionic species of aluminum are toxic, not only to the plant, but to many organisms such as the bacteria responsible for transformations in the nitrogen cycle. Aluminum damages the membranes of root cells and restricts the expansion of their walls, so the plant cannot grow properly. To promote benefits for agricultural production, soil remediation using limestone (CaCO 3) is recommended. This remediation promotes the following in the soil","decrease in pH, leaving it fertile.",solubilization of aluminum and its leaching by rain.,"interaction of the calcium ion with the aluminum ion, producing a metallic alloy.","reaction of calcium carbonate with aluminum ions, forming metallic aluminum.","increasing its alkalinity, making aluminum ions less available.",2018,132,CN,E,english
QUESTION 133,"With a view to improving the aesthetics of a vehicle, a sales clerk suggests to the consumer that he change the wheels on his car from a 15-inch rim to a 17-inch rim, which corresponds to a larger diameter of the wheel and tire set. Two consequences of changing the rim are:","Raising the position of the vehicle's center of mass, making it more unstable and increasing the car's speed in relation to that indicated on the speedometer.","Lowering the position of the vehicle's center of mass, making it more unstable and slowing down the car in relation to the speedometer.","Raise the position of the vehicle's center of mass, making it more stable, and increase the car's speed in relation to that indicated on the speedometer.","Lowering the position of the vehicle's center of mass, making it more stable and slowing down the car in relation to the speedometer.","Raise the position of the vehicle's center of mass, making it more stable, and lower the car's speed in relation to that indicated on the speedometer.",2018,133,CN,A,english
QUESTION 134,"Cells and organisms need to do work to stay alive and reproduce. The metabolic energy needed to carry out this work comes from the oxidation of fuels generated in the carbon cycle, through processes capable of interconverting different forms of energy. Flowchart description: A cyclical flowchart made up of four text boxes linked by clockwise arrows. From ""Process 1"" an arrow goes to ""Reduced fuels and O2"", from where another arrow goes to ""Process 2"", from where another arrow goes to ""CO2 and H 2O"", closing the cycle with an arrow that returns to ""Process 1"". In this cycle, the formation of fuels is linked to the conversion of energy",thermal into kinetic.,chemistry in thermal.,electrochemistry in heat.,kinetics in electromagnetics.,electromagnetics in chemistry.,2018,134,CN,E,english
QUESTION 135,"Oil is a low-cost source of energy that is widely used as a raw material for a wide variety of products. It is an oil made up of various substances of organic origin, mostly hydrocarbons of different molar masses. Separation techniques are used to obtain the marketable components of oil. In addition, in order to increase the quantity of marketable fractions, optimizing the product of fossil origin, the cracking process is used. What happens in this process?",Transformation of oil fractions into other smaller molecules.,Oxide-reduction reaction with electron transfer between molecules.,Solubilization of oil fractions using different solvents.,Decantation of molecules with different molar masses using centrifuges.,Separation of the different components of oil according to their boiling temperatures.,2018,135,CN,A,english
