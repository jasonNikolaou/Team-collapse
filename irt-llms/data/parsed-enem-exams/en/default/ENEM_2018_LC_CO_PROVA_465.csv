QUESTION 04,"TEXTO I A Free World-class Education for Anyone Anywhere The Khan Academy is an organization on a mission. We're a not-for-profit with the goal of changing education for the better by providing a free world-class education to anyone anywhere. All of the site's resources are available to anyone. The Khan Academy's materials and resources are available to you completely free of charge. TEXTO II I didn't have a problem with Khan Academy site until very recently. For me, the problem is the way Khan Academy is being promoted. The way the media sees it as “revolutionizing education”. The way people with power and money view education as simply “sit-and-get”. If your philosophy of education is “sit-and-get”, i.e., teaching is telling and learning is listening, then Khan Academy is way more efficient than classroom lecturing. Khan Academy does it better. But TRUE progressive educators, TRUE education visionaries and revolutionaries don't want to do these things better. We want to DO BETTER THINGS. Com o impacto das tecnologias e a ampliação das redes sociais, consumidores encontram na internet possibilidades de opinar sobre serviços oferecidos. Nesse sentido, o segundo texto, que é um comentário sobre o site divulgado no primeiro, apresenta a intenção do autor de",elogiar o trabalho proposto para a educação nessa era tecnológica.,reforçar como a mídia pode contribuir para revolucionar a educação.,chamar a atenção das pessoas influentes para o significado da educação.,destacar que o site tem melhores resultados do que a educação tradicional.,"criticar a concepção de educação em que se baseia a organização. Descrição do cartum: O cartum apresenta dois adolescentes caminhando lado a lado, com as mãos no bolso. Eles são muito parecidos e usam roupas semelhantes. Um deles diz: “When I was 5 everyone told me to be a big boy. When I was 10 they told me I should be more mature. Now they say it’s time to start acting like an adult. At this rate, I'll be eligible for social security before I graduate from High School!”.",2018,4,LC,E,english

QUESTION 01,"Crónica de una muerte anunciada Gabriel García Márquez El día en que lo iban a matar, Santiago Nasar se levantó a las 5:30 de la mañana para esperar el buque en que llegaba el obispo. Había soñado que atravesaba un bosque de higuerones donde caía una llovizna tierna, y por un instante fue feliz en el sueño, pero al despertar se sintió por completo salpicado de cagada de pájaros. “Siempre soñaba con árboles”, me dijo Plácida Linero, su madre, evocando 27 años después los pormenores de aquel lunes ingrato. “La semana anterior había soñado que iba solo en un avión de papel de estaño que volaba sin tropezar por entre los almendros”, me dijo. Tenía una reputación muy bien ganada de intérprete certera de los sueños ajenos, siempre que se los contaran en ayunas, pero no había advertido ningún augurio aciago en esos dos sueños de su hijo, ni en los otros sueños con árboles que él le había contado en las mañanas que precedieron a su muerte. Na introdução do romance, o narrador resgata lembranças de Plácida Linero relacionadas a seu filho Santiago Nasar. Nessa introdução, o uso da expressão augurio aciago  remete ao(à)",relação mística que se estabelece entre Plácida e seu filho Santiago.,"destino trágico de Santiago, que Plácida foi incapaz de prever nos sonhos.",descompasso entre a felicidade de Santiago nos sonhos e seu azar na realidade.,crença de Plácida na importância da interpretação dos sonhos para mudar o futuro.,presença recorrente de elementos sombrios que se revelam nos sonhos de Santiago.,2018,1,LC,B,spanish
QUESTION 02,"Revolución en la arquitectura china Levantar rascacielos en 19 días Un rascacielos de 57 pisos no llama la atención en la China del siglo XXI. Salvo que se haya construido en 19 días, claro. Y eso es precisamente lo que ha conseguido Broad Sustainable Building (BSB), una empresa dedicada a la fabricación de purificadores de aire y de equipos de aire acondicionado para grandes infraestructuras que ahora se ha empeñado en liderar una revolución con su propio modelo de arquitectura modular prefabricada. Como subraya su presidente, Zhang Yue, es una fórmula económica, ecológica, segura, y limpia. Ese último término, además, lo utiliza tanto para referirse al polvo que se produce en la construcción como a los gruesos sobres que suelen circular por debajo de las mesas en adjudicaciones y permisos varios. “Quiero que nuestros edificios alumbren una nueva era en la arquitectura, y que se conviertan en símbolo de la lucha contra la contaminación y el cambio climático, que es la mayor amenaza a la que se enfrenta la humanidad”, sentencia. “Es como montar un Lego. Apenas hay subcontratación, lo cual ayuda a mantener un costo bajo y un control de calidad estricto, y nos permite eliminar también la corrupción inherente al sector”, explica la vicepresidenta de BSB y responsable del mercado internacional, Jiang Yan.

Essa expressão indica que, além de produzir menos resíduos, o uso desse tipo de estrutura",reduz o contingente de mão de obra.,inibe a corrupção na construção civil.,facilita o controle da qualidade da obra.,apresenta um modelo arquitetônico conciso.,otimiza os custos da construção de edifícios.,2018,2,LC,B,spanish
QUESTION 03,"¿Qué es la X Solidaria ? La X Solidaria es una equis que ayuda a las personas más vulnerables. Podrás marcarla cuando hagas la declaración de la renta. Es la casilla que se denomina “Fines Sociales”. Nosotros preferimos llamarla X Solidaria : • porque al marcarla haces que se destine un  0,7 por ciento de tus impuestos a programas sociales que realizan las ONG. • porque se benefician los colectivos más desfavorecidos, sin ningún coste económico para ti. • porque NO marcarla es tomar una actitud pasiva, y dejar que sea el Estado quien decida el destino de esa parte de tus impuestos. • porque marcándola te conviertes en contribuyente activo solidario. As ações solidárias contribuem para o enfrentamento de problemas sociais. No texto, a ação solidária ocorre quando o contribuinte",delega ao governo o destino de seus impostos.,escolhe projetos que terão isenção de impostos.,destina parte de seus impostos para custeio de programas sociais.,determina a criação de impostos para implantação de projetos sociais.,seleciona programas para beneficiar cidadãos vulneráveis socialmente.,2018,3,LC,C,spanish
QUESTION 04,"¿Cómo gestionar la diversidad lingüística en el aula? El aprendizaje de idiomas es una de las demandas de la sociedad en la escuela: los alumnos tienen que finalizar la escolarización con un buen conocimiento, por lo menos, de las tres lenguas curriculares: catalán, castellano e inglés (o francés, portugués...). La metodología que promueve el aprendizaje integrado de idiomas en la escuela tiene en cuenta las relaciones entre las diferentes lenguas: la mejor enseñanza de una lengua incide en la mejora de todas las demás. Se trata de educar en y para la diversidad lingüística y cultural. Por eso, la V Jornada de Buenas Prácticas de Gestión del Multilingüismo, que se celebrará en Barcelona, debatirá sobre la gestión del multilingüismo en el aula. El objetivo es difundir propuestas para el aprendizaje integrado de idiomas y presentar experiencias prácticas de gestión de la diversidad lingüística presente en las aulas. Na região da Catalunha, Espanha, convivem duas línguas oficiais: o catalão e o espanhol. Além dessas, ensinam-se outras línguas nas escolas.

QUESTION 05,"Mayo 15 Que mañana no sea otro nombre de hoy Eduardo Galeano En el año 2011, miles de jóvenes, despojados de sus casas y de sus empleos, ocuparon las plazas y las calles de varias ciudades de España. Y la indignación se difundió. La buena salud resultó más contagiosa que las pestes, y las voces de los indignados atravesaron las fronteras dibujadas en los mapas. Así resonaron en el mundo: Nos dijeron “ ¡a la puta calle!”, y aquí estamos. Apaga la tele y enciende la calle. La llaman crisis, pero es estafa.No falta dinero: sobran ladrones.

QUESTION 06,"""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is turning 70 at a time of growing challenges, when hatred, discrimination and violence remain alive,"" said the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Audrey Azoulay. ""At the end of the Second World War, the whole of humanity resolved to promote human dignity everywhere and forever. In this spirit, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations,"" said Audrey.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promises to leave no one behind - and human rights must be the foundation for all progress."" According to her, this process needs to start as soon as possible at school desks.

QUESTION 09,"In sociology and literature, Brazilians have sometimes been treated as cordial and hospitable, but that's not what happens on social networks: the racial democracy proclaimed by Gilberto Freyre is far from what happens on a daily basis in the country's virtual communities. An unprecedented survey carried out by the Comunica que Muda [...] project shows the intolerance of Tupiniquim internet users in numbers. Between April and June, an algorithm searched [...] platforms for messages and texts on sensitive topics such as racism, political positioning and homophobia. It identified 393,284 mentions, 84 percent of which had a negative approach, exposing prejudice and discrimination. In addressing the attitude of Brazilian internet users mapped through a survey of virtual platforms, the text",minimizes the reach of digital communication.,refutes preconceived ideas about Brazilians.,relativizes responsibilities on the notion of respect.,exemplifies concepts contained in literature and sociology.,"exposes the ineffectiveness of studies to change this behavior.

QUESTION 11,TEXT I TEXT II,"body art puts the body so much in the spotlight and subjects it to such varied experimentation that its influence extends to the present day. If in today's art the possibilities for investigating the body seem limitless - you can choose between representing, presenting or even just evoking the body - this is thanks to the legacy of the pioneering artists.

QUESTION 12,"Visually impaired people can now go to some cinemas and theaters to enjoy the attractions on show more intensely. The Whatscine app, which recently arrived in Brazil and is available for the iOS (Apple) or Android (Google) operating systems, helps. When connected to the wi-fi network of cinemas and theaters, the app synchronizes an audio that describes what is happening on the screen or stage with the show in progress: the user can then listen to the narration on their cell phone. The program was developed by researchers at the Carlos III University in Madrid. ""In Spain, 200 movie theaters already offer the feature and films from major studios are already shown with the Whatscine! feature,"" says Brazilian Luis Mauch, who brought the technology to the country. ""In Brazil, we've already signed a partnership with the São Paulo Dance Company to adapt their shows! That's already a breakthrough. Do you agree?"" Because it is multiple and has peculiarities according to the sender's intention, language has different functions.

QUESTION 13,"TEXT I t TEXT II Let's imagine a citizen, living on the outskirts of a large urban center, who wakes up every day at 5 a.m. to go to work, faces an average of two hours on public transport, which is usually packed, to get to work at 8 a.m. He finishes work at 5 p.m. and gets home at 7 p.m. to take care of his household chores, etc. He finishes work at 5pm and gets home at 7pm to take care of the household chores, the children, etc. How do you tell this person that they should exercise because it's important for their health? How will they understand the message of the importance of physical exercise? This person is significantly less likely to exercise regularly than middle/upper class people who live in a different reality. In this case, the individual approach to the problem tends to make the person feel powerless for not being able to exercise and, consequently, guilty for being sedentary. The second text, which proposes a reflection on the first about the impact of changes in lifestyle on health, presents a vision of the impact of changes in lifestyle on health.","medicalized, which links the practice of physical exercise by any individual to the promotion of health.",which considers the social aspects involved in the practice of exercise in everyday life.,a critic who associates the interference of household chores with sedentary lifestyles.,which places responsibility for disease prevention on the individual.,"generational, which advocates the cult of youthfulness.",2018,13,LC,B,english
QUESTION 14,"In the traditional miss pageant, the candidates presented data on femicide, sexual abuse and rape in the country. Instead of height, weight, bust, waist and hip measurements, data on violence against women in Peru.  This is how the 23 candidates for Miss Peru 2017 protested against the high rates of femicide and sexual abuse in the country in the traditional swimsuit pageant. The political tone, however, marked the show from the beginning: right from the start, when the Peruvian women introduced themselves, one by one, they denounced moral and physical abuse, sexual exploitation, harassment, among other crimes against women. As for the materialization of language, the presentation of data on violence against women",is a discussion about the high rates of physical abuse against Peruvian women.,proposes a new format for female beauty pageants.,condemns the aesthetic rigor demanded by traditional competitions.,retrieves sensationalist information on the subject.,subverts the social function of the miss candidates' speech.,2018,14,LC,E,english

You have to close it down and reopen it. Don't feed the vultures. Or hope to the vultures. We need to shake off the dust. You have to be able to drink without offering yourself up as a holocaust. You have to. You have to not die just yet. You have to survive in order to verify. You have to stop thinking about Rogério's loneliness and leave him. You have to stop feeding the vultures.

QUESTION 16,"Vertigo Leonardo Fróes Only a few dry clumps of grass grow in the silent lowland that is lost to sight. Only one tree, large and sprawling but with very few leaves, opens up in tatters of shade. The only being in the vicinity, the woman is thin, bony and her face is windblown. You can't see her hair, which is covered by a dry cloth. But her eyes, her mouth, her skin - everything is suffocatingly dry. She is standing. Next to her is a stone. The sun explodes. She was standing at the end of the world. As if she were walking towards that low point, leaving behind her notions of herself. She has no pictures in her memory. Dispossessed and stripped, she doesn't wallow in self-accusations and remorse. She lives. It is only her shadow that keeps her company. Her shadow, which spills in thick lines onto the sand, sweetens the skeletal clarity like a gesture. The emptied woman becomes mute, desanguinates, crystallizes and mineralizes. She is almost as stone as the stone next to her. But the traces of her shadow move on and, becoming longer and thinner, stretch towards the shadowy rags of the tree's bones, with which they become entwined. In presenting the landscape and the character, the narrator establishes a correlation of meanings in which these elements intertwine. In this process, the human condition is configured",amalgamated by the common process of desertification and loneliness.,strengthened by the extensive adversity to the earth and living beings.,resized by the intensity of the light and the local exuberance.,immersed in an existential drama of identity and origin.,immobilized by scarcity and the oppression of the environment.,2018,16,LC,A,english
QUESTION 17,"It happened more than once: he abandoned me. Like all the others. The fifth. We'd been together for over a year. It seemed that this time it would be forever. But no: he suddenly disappeared, without a trace. The next thing I knew, I was calling for hours on end - but all I did was call, call, call and no one answered. So I did what had to be done: I blocked the line. The truth is that no cell phone can stand me. I've tried all the brands and operators, only to discover that they're all the same: at the first opportunity, they get hit. This last one took advantage of the fact that I was distracted and didn't get out of the cab with me. Or had he already jumped out of my pocket just as I was getting into the cab? Let's hope so. After doing what he did to me, I really want him to end up in the gutter. [...] If they'd left the way they came, fine. [...] But I know what I'm going to do. On the way to the cell phone store, I'm going to stop by a stationery store. Come to think of it, none of my little paper diaries have ever left me. In this fragment, in order to attract the reader's attention and establish a thread of meaning, the author uses",first person singular to give subjectivity to the account of yet another love disappointment.,irony to address the relationship with cell phones in the age of highly disposable products.,phrases used in the presentation of stereotyped love situations to build the setting of the text.,breaking expectations as an argumentative strategy to hide information.,verbs in the past tense to emphasize an approximation to the facts discussed throughout the text.,2018,17,LC,C,english
QUESTION 18,"Meanwhile, behind the scenes in the universe You plan to spend a long time in another country, working and studying, but the universe is preparing for the arrival of a love that will knock you off your feet, a love that will make you throw away your atlas and put down roots in your backyard like a fig tree. You're training for the most challenging marathon of all, but you won't arrive with both legs intact at the start, and the first perplexity will be this: the experience of frustration. The universe never delivers what it promises. In fact, it never promises anything, you're the one listening to voices. The day you think you have nothing to say to your analyst, you make the most bombshell revelation of your two years of therapy. The result of a routine examination turns your routine upside down. You hadn't imagined that so many friends would come to your party, and you hadn't imagined that your great crush wouldn't be there either. When you thought you looked beautiful, you didn't win any hearts. When you went out without make-up and in a threadbare T-shirt, you drew attention to yourself. And so the days go by, unplanned and against our will, because no matter how much we have rehearsed our speech and are prepared for the best scene, behind the scenes of the universe someone changes our role at the last minute, making our lives surprising. Among the argumentative strategies used to support the thesis presented in this fragment, the recurrence of","similar syntactic structures, to reinforce the speed of life's changes.","marks of interlocution, to bring the reader closer to the author's experiences.","verb forms in the present tense, to express the real possibilities of actions being carried out.","opposition constructions, to emphasize that expectations are affected by the unexpected.","descriptive sequences, to promote the reader's identification with the situations presented.",2018,18,LC,D,english

QUESTION 20,"Grandma, are you a lesbian? Natália Borges Polesso Grandma Clarissa dropped the cutlery on the plate, making the porcelain crackle. Joaquim, my cousin, kept his chin up, tapping his lips with his fork, waiting for an answer. Beatriz echoed the word as a question, ""What is a lesbian?"". I was speechless. Joaquim knew about me and would give me away to his grandmother and, later, to the whole family. I felt a lethal heat creep up my neck and ache behind my ears. I saw it coming: Grandma, are you a lesbian? Because Joana is. The shame was on my face and it gave me away even before the accusation. I squeezed my eyes shut and clutched my chest, waiting for the shot. [...] [...] I thought about how naturally Taís and I took our story. I thought about my insecurity about telling my family, I thought about all the classmates and teachers who already knew, I closed my eyes and saw my grandmother's mouth and Aunt Carolina's mouth touching, despite all the obstacles.

QUESTION 23,"The star rises Marques Rebelo The work wasn't hard: sticking labels, putting glasses in boxes, labeling them, sealing them, wrapping them in cellophane, white, green, blue, depending on the product, separating them into dozens... It was tedious. To make the eight hours pass more quickly, there was a remedy: talking. It was forbidden, but who went after prohibitions? Did the boss come? Did the foreman come? They shut up and got down to work. As soon as they turned their backs, they'd start chattering again. Their hands wouldn't stop, their tongues wouldn't stop. In these endless conversations, with their loose language and raw subjects, Leniza completed herself. Isabela, Afonsina, Idália, Jurete, Deolinda - they were masters. The world had just unraveled. Leniza lost the naive tone she still had. She gained an inviting play of body, a snap of eyes that promises everything, for nothing, free of charge. The timbre of her voice changed. It became warmer. Her intelligence has changed. It became sharper, more trepidatious. The novel, from 1939, brings to the scene types and situations that mirror the Rio de Janeiro of that decade.

It shows that the presence of negative stereotypes in these images disseminates a racist imaginary presented in the form of a racist aesthetic that camouflages exclusion and normalizes the inferiority suffered by black people in Brazilian society. The analysis of the imagery points to the aesthetic devaluation of black people, especially black women, and the idealization of beauty and whitening to be achieved through the use of the products presented. The media-advertising discourse of beauty products recalls and legitimizes the practice of a racist ethic that is built and active in everyday life. In light of this discussion, it is suggested that anti-racism work, carried out in various social spaces, should consider the use of strategies for an ""aesthetic decolonization"" that empowers black subjects through their aesthetic valorization and protagonism in the construction of an ethic of diversity. Keywords: Aesthetics, racism, media, education, diversity. The fulfillment of the referential function of language is a characteristic feature of the academic article summary genre. In the structure of this text, this function is established by the","impersonality, in the organization of the objectivity of the information, as in ""This article has the purpose"" and ""It is evident"".","lexical selection, in the sequential development of the text, as in ""racist imaginary"" and ""aesthetics of black people"".","metaphorization, related to the construction of figurative meanings, as in the expressions ""aesthetic decolonization"" and ""media-advertising discourse"".","nominalization, produced through derivational processes in word formation, such as ""inferiorization"" and ""devaluation"".","adjectivation, organized to create anti-racist terminology, as in ""ethics of diversity"" and ""aesthetic decolonization"".

QUESTION 26,"Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games are more than a race for records, medals and the pursuit of excellence. Behind them lies the philosophy of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the Olympic Movement. As an educator, he saw the Games as an opportunity for people to develop values that could be applied not only to sport, but to education and society.

QUESTION 27,"More big than bang Last week, the world's scientific community received official confirmation of a discovery that had been talked about with great anticipation for some months. Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics revealed that they had obtained the strongest evidence to date that the universe we live in did indeed begin with the Big Bang, but this was not an explosion, but a sudden expansion of infinite matter and energy concentrated in a microscopic point which, without many semantic options, scientists call a ""singularity"". This cosmic seed remained in a latent state and, with no definitive explanation yet, began to swell rapidly [...].

QUESTION 29,"TEXT I Also called photogrammatic prints or images [...], photograms are, in a generic definition, images made without the use of a photographic camera, by direct contact of an object or material with a photosensitive surface exposed to a light source. This technique, which was born alongside photography and served as a model for many discussions on the ontology of the photographic image, was profoundly transformed by avant-garde artists in the first decades of the 20th century. It even represented, alongside collages, photomontages and other technical procedures, the definitive incorporation of photography into modern art and its move away from figurative representation.

QUESTION 33,"Liesel Meminger's story is told by a morbid, surprisingly sympathetic narrator. When Death realizes that the little book thief escapes him, he becomes attached to the girl and traces her footsteps from 1939 to 1943. Traces of a survivor: her communist mother, persecuted by the Nazis, sends Liesel and her brother to the poor suburbs of a German town, where a couple are willing to adopt them for money. The boy dies on the way and is buried by a gravedigger who drops a book in the snow. It is the first in a series that the girl will steal over the years. Her only link to her family is this book, which she still can't read. Life around her is the pseudo-reality created around the cult of Hitler in the Second World War. She watches the euphoric celebration of the Führer's birthday in the neighborhood.

A man passed by and said: ""That circle that the river makes behind your house is called a cove"". It was no longer the image of a glass snake circling behind the house, it was a cove.

QUESTION 37,"""Acuenda o Pajubá"": get to know the ""secret dialect"" used by gays and transvestites Originating in Yoruba, the language was adopted by transvestites and won over the community ""Nhaí, amapô! Don't get crazy and pay for my acué, stop being an equê or I'll pull your picumã!"" Did you understand the words of that phrase? If so, it's because you know something about pajubá, the ""secret dialect"" of gays and transvestites. A lawyer who is adept at using these expressions, even in the most formal settings, says: ""Of course I won't speak them during a hearing or in a meeting, but at the firm, with my work colleagues, I speak 'acué' all the time,"" he jokes. ""We have to be careful when we speak other words because nowadays people understand, right? It's on the internet, there's even a dictionary..."", he comments. The dictionary he's referring to is Aurélia, a dictionary of the sharp tongue, launched in 2006 and written by journalist Angelo Vip and Fred Libi. In the book, there are more than 1,300 entries revealing the meaning of pajubá words.

QUESTION 42,"The Glass House Ivan Ângelo There were protests. Each child was given a ball and time to play. They learned incredible juggling skills and some traveled the world showing off their joyful abilities. (The problem was that many, most, were not good at it and were ugly at night, frightening. It would be better to arrest these people - some said.) There were protests. They raised the price of meat, freed up grain prices and opened up low-interest credit for farmers. Whatever money was left over, well, let's just say, whatever money was left over! There were protests. Wages were lowered (unfortunately the number of robberies increased) because we need to fight inflation and, as we know, when wages are above the productivity index they become highly inflationary, so there were protests. There were protests. Protests were banned, and instead of protests, hatred was born. So the Glass House was created to put an end to that hatred.

QUESTION 43,"Based on supposedly scientific arguments, the myth of the weaker sex has historically contributed to controlling women's bodily practices. In the history of Brazil, precisely in the transition between the 19th and 20th centuries, efforts to prevent women from taking part in sporting activities stand out. The mistrust of women in sport was culturally associated with the fear of masculinizing the female body through intense physical effort. In relation to women's soccer, the myth of the weaker sex acted as an obstacle by consolidating the belief that physical effort was inappropriate to protect the femininity of ""normal"" women. This myth sustained a strong movement against the acceptance of soccer as a female sport. Laws and advertisements sought to discredit soccer, considering it unsuitable for delicacy. In fact, women were considered incapable of adapting to the multiple difficulties of the ""king sport"".
