QUESTION 46,"In the African empire of Mali, in the 14th century, Tombuctu was the center of an international trade where everything was traded - salt, slaves, seafood, etc. There was also a large trade in books on history, medicine, astronomy and mathematics, as well as a high concentration of students. The cultural importance of Tombuctu can be seen in an old proverb: ""Salt comes from the north, gold from the south, but the words of God and the treasures of wisdom come from Tombuctu"". One explanation for the dynamism of this city and its historical importance in the period mentioned was the following",geographical isolation from the Western Sahara.,intensive exploitation of natural resources.,relative position in the circulation networks.,transatlantic slave labor trade.,economic competition from the kingdoms of the region.,2017,46,CH,C,english
QUESTION 47,"Following the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, UNESCO published studies by scientists from all over the world that discredited racist doctrines and demonstrated the unity of the human race. Since then, most European scientists themselves have come to recognize the discriminatory nature of the white man's alleged racial superiority and to condemn the aberrations committed in his name. The position taken by UNESCO from 1948 onwards was motivated by recent events, among which the following stood out",Japanese attack on the American military base at Pearl Harbor.,the outbreak of the Cold War and new rivalries between nations.,death of millions of soldiers in the fighting of the Second World War.,execution of Jews and Slavs imprisoned in Nazi ghettos and concentration camps.,the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by US forces.,2017,47,CH,D,english
QUESTION 48,"Morality, Bentham urged, is not a matter of pleasing God, much less of adherence to abstract rules. Morality is the attempt to create the greatest possible amount of happiness in this world. When deciding what to do, we should therefore ask what course of conduct would promote the greatest amount of happiness for all those who will be affected. The parameters of action indicated in the text are in line with a",scientific basis with a positivist bias.,normative social convention.,religious behavioral transgression.,pragmatic rationality.,passionate inclination.,2017,48,CH,D,english
QUESTION 49,"There's a lot of talk these days about human rights. Well, it was in the 18th century - in 1789 precisely - that a Constituent Assembly produced and proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in Paris. This Declaration was necessary for a group of revolutionaries because it had been prepared by a change in ideas and mentalities: the Enlightenment. By correlating historical temporalities, the text presents a conception of thought that has as one of its foundations the",modernizing school education.,updating christian moral discipline.,spreading aristocratic customs.,socialization of scientific knowledge.,universalization of the principle of civil equality.,2017,49,CH,E,english
QUESTION 50,"The 1988 Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil states: Article 231. Indians are recognized for their social organization, customs, languages, beliefs and traditions, and for their original rights over the lands they traditionally occupy, and the Union is responsible for demarcating, protecting and ensuring respect for all their property. The persistence of claims regarding the application of this normative precept is due to the fundamental historical link between",ethnicity and racial miscegenation.,society and legal equality.,space and cultural survival.,progress and environmental education.,well-being and economic modernization.,2017,50,CH,C,english
QUESTION 51,"Photograph description: A black woman is seated, elegantly dressed, adorned with jewelry and wearing a shawl, with a white boy leaning against her right side, standing with his head and left hand delicately resting on her shoulder and his right hand holding her arm; both are posing for a photo. The caption reads: ""Photograph of Augusto Gomes Leal and nursemaid Mônica, business card from 1860"". The photo, dated 1860, is an indication of the slave culture in Brazil, as it expresses the","ambiguity of the domestic work carried out by the wet nurse, developing a relationship of proximity and subordination in relation to the masters.","integration of slaves into the values of the middle classes, cultivating the family as a pillar of imperial society.","an improvement in the slaves' living conditions as seen in their luxurious clothing, associating domestic work with privileges for the captives.","sphere of private life, centralizing the female figure to mark the work of women in the literate education of children.","ethnic distinction between masters and slaves, demarcating coexistence between social strata as a means of overcoming mestizaje.",2017,51,CH,A,english
QUESTION 52,"The conﬁguration of the urban space of the Entorno do Distrito Federal region is similar to other urban agglomerations and metropolitan regions in the country, where it is easy to identify a dynamic and developed center, where job opportunities and the main services are concentrated, and a peripheral region concentrating the low-income population, with restricted access to the main activities with the capacity for accumulation and productivity, and to social services and basic infrastructure. The internal organization of the urban agglomeration described is the result of the process of",vertical expansion.,national polarization.,municipal emancipation.,socio-spatial segregation.,commercial deregulation.,2017,52,CH,D,english
QUESTION 53,"Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile have decided to take a shorter route to regional integration. In mid-2012, the four countries created the Pacific Alliance and in 2013 eliminated tariffs on 90 percent of all products traded across their borders. The agreement described in the text had the following economic objectives for the member countries",promote the free movement of workers.,promoting competitiveness in the foreign market.,restrict investments by multinational companies.,adopt exchange rate measures to subsidize the agricultural sector.,reduce customs duties to encourage consumption.,2017,53,CH,B,english
QUESTION 54,"Table description: Indicates the typology of areas in relation to the percentage of rainfall retained on site and the percentage of rainfall run-off, presenting the following data: - Natural/forest basins: with 80 to 100 percent of rainfall retained on site and 0 to 20 percent of rainfall run-off; - Basins with agricultural/crop occupation: with 40 to 60 percent of rainfall retained on site and 40 to 60 percent of rainfall run-off; - Basins with residential occupation: with 40 to 50 percent of rainfall retained on site and 50 to 60 percent of rainfall run-off; - Basins with heavy urban occupation: with 0 to 10 percent of rainfall retained on site and 90 to 100 percent of rainfall run-off. Reading the data reveals that areas with greater vegetation cover have the potential to intensify the rainfall process.",laminar erosion.,physical weathering.,flooding in cities.,soil compaction.,recharge two aquifers.,2017,54,CH,E,english
QUESTION 55,"Accelerated wear and tear will always exist if the farmer does not take due care to combat the causes, which are related to various processes, such as: chemical depletion and leaching caused by the exhaustion caused by crops and the vertical washing away of nutrients from the water that enters the soil, as well as the removal of nutritious elements with crops. The nutrients removed, when not replaced, are often replaced by toxic elements such as aluminum. The environmental dynamics exemplified in the text generate the following consequences for arable soil:",Increased acidity.,Increase in salinity.,Formation of gullies.,Removal of the top layer.,Intensification of surface flow.,2017,55,CH,A,english
QUESTION 56,"The biggest consumers of logistics infrastructure for exports in Brazil are bulk products, including iron ore, oil and its derivatives and soybeans, which, because they have low added value and are moved in large volumes, require a large infrastructure and low costs. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves a lot to be desired, resulting in huge lines of ships, trucks and trains which, because they are idle in the lines for a large part of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting his profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness. In the context of the early 21st century, one way of solving the soybean logistics problems presented in the text would be to",exemption from transport taxes.,construction of mooring terminals.,diversification of trade partners.,hiring port workers.,intensiﬁcation of road policing.,2017,56,CH,B,english
QUESTION 57,"The diversity of activities related to the tertiary sector reinforces the more general trend towards deindustrialization in many developed countries, without them losing control of the economy. This change implies a new international division of labor, which is no longer based on the clear sectoral segmentation of economic activities. In this context, one of the results of the phenomenon described is the",saturation of the secondary sector.,expanding labor rights.,bipolarization of geopolitical power.,consolidation of technological mastery.,primarization of global exports.,2017,57,CH,D,english
QUESTION 58,"Many countries are characterized by having multi-ethnic populations. They have often evolved this way over centuries. Other societies have become multi-ethnic more quickly, as a result of policies encouraging migration, or because of colonial and imperial legacies. From the point of view of the functioning of contemporary democracies, the model of society described demands both,",defense of patriotism and rejection of hybridity.,universalization of rights and respect for diversity.,segregating the territory and encouraging self-government.,language compensation and homogenization policies.,standardization of culture and repression of particularisms.,2017,58,CH,B,english
QUESTION 59,"Climatogram description: Shows the annual variation in temperature and rainfall in a city, with the following data: - from January to the end of March: the temperature rose from approximately minus 10 degrees Celsius to 0 degrees Celsius, while rainfall fell from over 40 millimeters to just over 30 millimeters; - from the end of March to July: the temperature rose from 0 degrees Celsius to a peak of just under 20 degrees Celsius, while rainfall rose from over 30 millimeters to approximately 90 millimeters; and - from July onwards: the temperature began a process of falling until it reached 0 degrees Celsius in early November, dropping further in December to approximately minus 10 degrees Celsius, while rainfall fell from 90 millimeters to just over 50 millimeters in December. Map description: The world map indicates the cities of Moscow and Barcelona, in Europe; Mumbai, in Asia; Cape Town, in Africa; and Sydney, in Oceania. The average monthly temperatures and rainfall rates expressed in the climatogram show the typical climate of the following city:","Cape Town (South Africa), marked by a low annual temperature range.","Sydney (Australia), characterized by abundant rainfall throughout the year.","Mumbai (India), damaged by torrential monsoon rains.","Barcelona (Spain), affected by dry air masses.","Moscow (Russia), influenced by its geographical location in high altitude.",2017,59,CH,E,english
QUESTION 60,"In his book Development as Freedom, Amartya Sen writes: We seek to demonstrate that development can be seen as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. The focus on human freedoms contrasts with narrower views of development, such as those that identify development with growth in Gross National Product, or industrialization. GNP growth can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights. The concept of development proposed in the text is based on the link between",increase in industry and operations in the financial market.,creation of welfare programs and price controls.,increase in average income and tax collection.,guaranteeing citizenship and economic advancement.,adjustment of economic policies and fiscal incentives.,2017,60,CH,D,english
QUESTION 61,"The first Gulf War, genuinely supported by the United Nations and the international community, as well as the immediate reaction to 9/11, demonstrated the strength of the United States' position in the post-Soviet era. One aspect that explains the strength of the United States, as pointed out in the text, is the following",power of its military bases around the world.,Russia's geopolitical alignment with the US.,Cuba's policy of territorial expansionism.,strategic alliance with oil-producing countries such as Kuwait and Iran.,China's incorporation into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).,2017,61,CH,A,english
QUESTION 62,"The New Deal aims to re-establish the balance between production costs and prices, between town and country, between agricultural prices and industrial prices, to reactivate the internal market - the only important one - by controlling prices and production, by revaluing wages and the purchasing power of the masses, i.e. farmers and workers, and by regulating employment conditions. With reference to the historical conditions of the interwar period, the government measures described were aimed at",making the rules of the financial market more flexible.,strengthen the regressive taxation system.,introduce credit restraint measures.,rationalizing the costs of industrial automation through union negotiations.,recompose the mechanisms of economic accumulation through state intervention.,2017,62,CH,E,english
QUESTION 63,"In the Futurist Manifesto, Marinetti writes: And come, then, the joyful arsonists with charred fingers! Let's go! Set fire to library shelves! Divert the canals to flood the museums! Wield pickaxes, axes and hammers and mercilessly tear down venerated cities! What defining principle of Futurism and common to various artistic and cultural currents of the first three decades of the 20th century is highlighted in the text?",Tradition is an inescapable force.,Art is an expression of collective memory.,Modernity is the decisive overcoming of history.,Cultural reality is economically determined.,Memory is a crucial element of cultural identity.,2017,63,CH,C,english
QUESTION 64,"In A Theory of Justice, John Rawls writes: A society is a more or less self-sufficient association of persons who in their mutual relations recognize certain rules of conduct as obligatory and who, for the most part, act in accordance with them. A society is well-ordered not only when it is designed to promote the good of its members, but also when it is effectively regulated by a public conception of justice. That is, it is a society in which everyone accepts, and knows that others accept, the same principle of justice. The vision expressed in this 20th century text refers to which aspect of modern thought?",The relationship between freedom and autonomy in Liberalism.,The independence of power and morality in Rationalism.,The convention between citizens and sovereign in Absolutism.,The dialectic between the individual and the autocratic government of Idealism.,The contrast between goodness and the savage condition of Naturalism.,2017,64,CH,A,english
QUESTION 65,"The book The Pre-Socratics states: Democritus' representation is similar to that of Anaxagoras, in that an inﬁnitely multiple is the origin; but in him the determination of the fundamental principles appears in such a way that it contains that which for which it was formed is absolutely not the simple aspect for itself. For example, particles of flesh and gold would be principles which, through their concentration, form what appears as a picture. The text makes a critical presentation of Democritus' thinking, according to which the ""constitutive principle of things"" was represented by the following","number, which underlies the creation of the gods.","becoming, which symbolizes the constant movement of objects.","water, which expresses the material cause of the origin of the universe.","immobility, which sustains the existence of the timeless being.","atom, which explains the emergence of entities.",2017,65,CH,E,english
QUESTION 66,"A conversation of this kind transforms the listener; Socrates' contact paralyzes and embarrasses; it leads them to reflect on themselves, to give their attention an unusual direction: temperamental people like Alcibiades know that they will find all the good they are capable of with him, but they run away because they fear this powerful influence, which leads them to reproach themselves. It is above all to these young people, many of whom are almost children, that he tries to give his guidance. The text highlights characteristics of the Socratic way of life, which was based on",contemplation of the mythical tradition.,underpinning the dialectical method.,relativization of true knowledge.,valuing rhetorical argumentation.,investigating the foundations of nature.,2017,66,CH,B,english
QUESTION 67,"The vast majority of democratic Western countries have adopted the Constitutional Court as a mechanism for controlling the other powers. The inclusion of the courts in the political arena has meant changes in the calculus for implementing public policies. The government, in addition to negotiating its political plan with Parliament, had to take care not to infringe the Constitution. This new institutional architecture led to the development of a political environment that made it possible for the judiciary to participate in decision-making processes. The text refers to an important change in the dynamics of how contemporary states operate which, in the case of Brazil, resulted in the",adoption of elections for the high judiciary.,reducing tensions between federal entities.,suspension of the general principle of checks and balances.,judicialization of issues that fall within the legislative sphere.,proﬁssionalization of the judiciary's staff.,2017,67,CH,D,english
QUESTION 68,"By destroying a landscape of trees with twisted trunks, leaves and rough shrubs over acidic soils, often laterized or taken over by the bizarre forms of termite mounds, this modernization linearizes and apparently does not allow the modernist claim that form should follow function to be questioned. The process described takes place in a biogeographical area with a predominance of vegetation",tropical climate.,xeróﬁla and semi-arid climate.,and equatorial climate.,aciculifoliate and subtropical climate.,semideciduous and humid tropical climate.,2017,68,CH,A,english
QUESTION 69,"The installation of a plant takes into account various technical factors. One of the most important is its location, which must be close to both consumption centers and production areas. Petrobras has plants strategically distributed throughout the country. They are responsible for processing millions of barrels of oil a day, supplying the market with derivatives that can be obtained from domestic or imported oil. The territorialization of a production unit depends on various locational factors. From reading the text, the determining factor for the installation of oil refineries is their proximity to",headquarters of petrochemical companies.,derivatives import zones.,technological development hubs.,labor agglomeration areas.,spaces with circulation infrastructure.,2017,69,CH,E,english
QUESTION 70,"But it was mainly the wool that buyers from Flanders and Italy were looking for everywhere. To satisfy them, the breeds were improved by progressively increasing their size. This growth continued throughout the 13th century, and the abbeys of the Cistercian Order, where the most rational methods of cattle breeding were used, certainly played a decisive role in this improvement. The text points to the relationship between the improvement of pastoral activity and technical progress in feudal Western Europe, which resulted from the following",the growth of slave labor.,development of urban life.,standardization of local taxes.,standardization of the production process.,deconcentration of the land structure.,2017,70,CH,B,english
QUESTION 71,"Description of infographic: Shows the efficiency ranking of the ten largest hydroelectric plants in Brazil, comparing the area flooded and the energy produced by these plants: - Itaipu, in Paraná: with a flooded area of 1,400 square kilometers and power of 14,000 megawatts; - Belo Monte, in Pará: with a flooded area of 0,500 square kilometers and power of 11,200 megawatts; - Tucuruí, in Pará: with a flooded area of 3,500 square kilometers and power of 8,700 megawatts; - Jirau, in Rondônia: with a flooded area of 0.3 thousand square kilometers and power of 3.8 thousand megawatts; - Ilha Solteira, in São Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul: with a flooded area of 1.2 thousand square kilometers and power of 3.4 thousand megawatts; - Xingó, in Alagoas and Sergipe: with a flooded area of 0.1 thousand square kilometers and a power output of 3.2 thousand megawatts; - Santo Antônio, in Rondônia: with a flooded area of 0.4 thousand square kilometers and a power output of 3.2 thousand megawatts; - Marimbondo, in São Paulo and Minas Gerais: with a flooded area of 0.4 thousand square kilometers and power of 1.4 thousand megawatts; - Serra da Mesa, in Goiás: with a flooded area of 1.8 thousand square kilometers and power of 1.3 thousand megawatts; - Sobradinho, in Bahia: with a flooded area of 4.1 thousand square kilometers and power of 1.1 thousand megawatts. Comparing the data on the hydroelectric plants, a positive territorial characteristic of Belo Monte is its",reduced relative space flooded.,the steepness of the local terrain.,high rate of regional urbanization.,presence of large industrial parks.,proximity to strategic international borders.,2017,71,CH,A,english
QUESTION 72,"It's about the progressive loss of productivity of entire biomes, affecting very significant portions of the subhumid and semi-arid domains in all the hot regions of the world. It is in these ecologically transitional areas that the pressure on biomass is felt very strongly, due to the removal of forest cover, overgrazing and uncontrolled mining activities, triggering an acute picture of environmental degradation, reflected in the inability to support the development of plant species, whether natural forest or agricultural plantations. The text emphasizes a consequence of the conflicting relationship between human society and the environment, which concerns the process of",thermal inversion.,atmospheric pollution.,eutroﬁzation of water.,soil contamination.,desertification of ecosystems.,2017,72,CH,E,english
QUESTION 73,"Since the last decades of the 20th century, the phenomenon of population mobility has shown significant changes in its behavior, not only in Brazil but also in other parts of the world. These new processes are materialized, among other aspects, in the internal dimension, by the redirection of migratory flows towards medium-sized cities, to the detriment of the large urban centers; by short trips over shorter distances; by commuter movements, which are becoming more important in survival strategies, and are no longer restricted to the large urban agglomerations. The redeﬁnition of internal migratory flows in Brazil, in the period mentioned in the text, is due to the intensiﬁcation of the immigration process.",decapitalization of the primary sector.,expansion of the informal economy.,taxation of the city's residential area.,deconcentration of industrial activity.,saturation of employment in the tertiary sector.,2017,73,CH,D,english
QUESTION 74,"Women's participation in the political decision-making process is still extremely limited in practically all countries, regardless of the economic and social regime and institutional structure in force in each of them. It is a public and notorious fact, as well as empirically proven, that women are generally under-represented in bodies of power, as the proportion never corresponds to the relative weight of this part of the population. Within the Brazilian Legislative Branch, the attempt to reverse this situation of under-representation has involved the implementation by the State of",laws to combat domestic violence.,gender quotas in party candidacies.,political mobilization programs in schools.,advertisements encouraging conscious voting.,financial support for women leaders.,2017,74,CH,B,english
QUESTION 75,"Palestinians gathered in front of television sets and screens set up outdoors in Ramallah, in the West Bank, to follow the vote on the resolution calling for the recognition of so-called Palestine as a non-member observer state of the United Nations (UN). The aim was to wait for the birth, at least formally, of a Palestinian state. After the resolution was passed, hundreds of people took to the town square with Palestinian flags, let off fireworks, honked horns and danced in the streets. Approved by 138 votes out of 193 in the General Assembly, the resolution raises the status of the Palestinian state before the organization. This UN resolution endorsed the following",institutional delimitation of territorial borders.,increasing the quality of life of the local population.,implementation of the peace treaty with the Israelis.,support from the international community for the national demand.,equalization of the political condition with that of other countries.,2017,75,CH,D,english
QUESTION 76,"I was born to a black woman, a free African, from the Mina Coast (Nagô Nation), named Luiza Mahin, a pagan who always refused baptism and Christian doctrine. My mother was short in stature, slim, beautiful, her color was a dull black, her teeth were as white as snow, she was very haughty, hot-tempered and unsophisticated. She was involved in commerce - she was a greengrocer, very hard-working and, more than once, in Bahia, she was arrested on suspicion of being involved in plans for slave insurrection, which had no effect. In this excerpt from his memoirs, Luiz Gama emphasizes the importance of",bonds of family solidarity.,strategies of cultural resistance.,mechanisms of tribal hierarchization.,instruments of religious domination.,limits to the granting of freedom.,2017,76,CH,B,english
QUESTION 77,"Description of figure 1: Shows the formation of the sea breeze as follows: the breeze, under high pressure, is driven from the sea, a warm environment, to the land, a warm environment, where, under low pressure, the breeze is driven upwards. Description of figure 2: It shows the formation of the terral as follows: the breeze, under high pressure, is propelled from the land, a cold environment, to the sea, a warm environment, where, under low pressure, the breeze is propelled upwards. The images show information on the formation of breezes in coastal areas. This process is the result of",uniformity of the atmospheric pressure gradient.,differential surface heating.,of thermal media.,changes in relative humidity.,sharp variations in altitude.,2017,77,CH,B,english
QUESTION 78,"During the Estado Novo, those in charge of propaganda tried to perfect the art of exciting and involving the ""crowds"" through political messages. In this type of discourse, the meaning of the words mattered little because, as Goebbels declared, ""we don't speak to say something, but to achieve a certain effect"". Control over the media was a hallmark of the Estado Novo, and was fundamental to political propaganda, insofar as it aimed to",gain popular support to legitimize the new government.,broaden the involvement of the crowds in political decisions.,increase the supply of public information to civil society.,extend the democratic participation of the media in Brazil.,broaden the public's understanding of the new government's intentions.,2017,78,CH,A,english
QUESTION 79,"TEXT I Solon is the first Greek name that comes to mind when land and debt are mentioned together. Soon after 600 years BC, he was appointed ""legislator"" in Athens, with unprecedented powers, because the demand for land redistribution and debt cancellation could no longer be blocked by the oligarchy of landowners through force or small concessions. TEXT II The ""Law of the Twelve Tables"" became one of the fundamental texts of Roman law, one of the main Roman legacies that have come down to us. The publication of these laws, around 450 years BC, was important because knowledge of the ""rules of the game"" of life in society is a favorable instrument for the common man and potentially limits the hegemony and arbitrariness of the powerful. The point of convergence between the socio-political realities indicated in the texts is the idea that the",discussion of formal precepts established democracy.,The invention of legal codes dismantled the aristocracies.,formulation of official regulations established the companies.,The definition of moral principles ended conflicts of interest.,the creation of collective standards has reduced inequalities in treatment.,2017,79,CH,E,english
QUESTION 80,"With the Land Law of 1850, access to land only became possible through purchase with payment in cash. This limited, or even practically prevented, access to land for slave laborers who gained their freedom. The legal fact highlighted in the text accentuated the process of",land reform.,mercantile expansion.,land concentration.,de-ruralization of the elite.,mechanization of production.,2017,80,CH,C,english
QUESTION 81,"As you know, there are two candidates for the presidency, Mr. Eduardo Gomes and Mr. Eurico Dutra, and a third, Mr. Getúlio Vargas, who must be the candidate of some hidden political group, but is also the popular candidate. Because there are two ""we want"": the ""we want"" of those who want to see if they remain in their positions and the popular ""we want""... After all, what is Mr. Getúlio Vargas?  Is he a fascist? Is he a communist? Is he an atheist? Is he a Christian? Does he want to leave? Does he want to stay? The people, however, seem to like him for that very reason, because he's ""the house style"". The political movement mentioned in the 1945 text was characterized by",demand the participation of party organizations.,support the continuation of the dictatorship of the state.,demand the conﬁrmation of labor rights.,claim the constitutional transition under the influence of the ruler.,Rescue the representativeness of trade unions under social control.,2017,81,CH,D,english
QUESTION 82,"In Gazeta de Notícias in 1892, Machado de Assis wrote: The popular institute, according to the examination of reason, has made the figure of Ensign Xavier the principal of the inconﬁdents, and has placed his partners at half a ration of glory. Those others certainly deserve our esteem; they were patriots. But the one who offered to carry the sinners of Israel, the one who wept with joy when he saw the death sentence of his companions commuted, a sentence that was only going to be carried out on him, the hanged, the quartered, the beheaded, he must receive the prize in proportion to his martyrdom, and win for all, since he paid for all. In the process of transition to the Republic, Machado's narrative about the Inconﬁdência Mineira associates",Christian redemption and civic culture.,veneration of saints and military radicalism.,apologia for Protestants and ufanistic worship.,messianic tradition and regionalist tendency.,ecclesiastical representation and ideological dogmatism.,2017,82,CH,A,english
QUESTION 83,"In the period before the military coup of 1964, the bishops' documents indicated that economic development, and clearly capitalist development, oriented towards the fair distribution of wealth, would solve the problem of rural poverty and, consequently, remove the possibility of proselytizing and communist expansion among the peasants. It was in this sense that the coup d'état of March 31, 1964, was welcomed by the Church. Despite the disagreements within the clergy after the installation of the civil-military dictatorship, the position mentioned in the text was based on the Catholic hierarchy's understanding that the",class struggle is stimulated by the free market.,oligarchic power is limited by the action of the army.,Christian doctrine is benefited by the backwardness of the interior.,he political space is dominated by business interests.,ideological manipulation is favored by material deprivation.,2017,83,CH,E,english
QUESTION 84,"In Habermas' thinking, the concept of democracy is built on a procedural dimension, based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of making political decisions takes place on the basis of a broad public discussion, and only then can decisions be made. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of weighting and analysis, permeated by discourse, which precedes the decision. The concept of democracy proposed by Jürgen Habermas can favor processes of social inclusion. According to the text, the following is a condition for this to happen",periodic direct citizen participation.,free and rational debate between citizens and the state.,interlocution between the branches of government.,election of political leaders with temporary mandates.,control of political power by more enlightened citizens.,2017,84,CH,B,english
QUESTION 85,"In his work The Metaphysics of Morals, Immanuel Kant writes: A person is forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows very well that he won't be able to pay it back, but he also sees that he won't be lent anything unless he promises ﬁrmly to pay it back within a certain period of time. She feels the temptation to make the promise, but she still has enough conscience to ask herself: isn't it forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way? Assuming that she decides to do so, her maxim of action would be: when I think I'm in trouble for money, I'll borrow it and promise to pay it back, even though I know this will never happen. According to Kantian morality, the ""false promise to pay"" represented in the text",ensures that the action is accepted by everyone through free participatory discussion.,ensures that the effects of actions do not destroy the possibility of future life on earth.,opposes the principle that every human action can be used as a universal norm.,materializes in the understanding that the ends of human action can justify the means.,allows individual action to produce the broadest happiness for the people involved.,2017,85,CH,C,english
QUESTION 86,"The earthquake measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale that hit the west coast of Chile in February caused significant changes to the map of the region. According to a preliminary analysis, the entire city of Concepción moved at least three meters to the west. Buenos Aires moved about 2.5 centimeters to the west, while Santiago, closest to the site of the event, moved almost 30 centimeters to the west-southwest. The cities of Valparaíso, in Chile, and Mendoza, in Argentina, also had their positions altered significantly (13.4 centimeters and 8.8 centimeters, respectively). The text highlights a type of geological event that is frequent in certain parts of the Earth's surface. These events are concentrated in","volcanic areas, where magmatic material rises to form mountain ranges.","coastal strips, where the ocean floor receives sediment, causing tsunamis.","narrow bands of seismic intensity at the contact of tectonic plates, close to modern folds.","crystalline shields, where the rocks are subjected to weathering processes, with sudden changes in temperature.","areas of ancient sedimentary basins, located in the center of tectonic plates, in regions known as hot spots.",2017,86,CH,C,english

QUESTION 88,"If, then, for the things we do there is an end that we desire for its own sake, and everything else is desired in the interest of that end, then evidently that end will be the good, or rather, the highest good. But doesn't knowledge have a great influence on this life? If so, let's try to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and which of the sciences or faculties it is the object of. No one will doubt that its study belongs to the most prestigious art, which can most truly be called the master art. Now, politics proves to be of this nature, since it determines which sciences should be studied in a state, which ones each citizen should learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the faculties held in higher esteem, such as strategy, economics and rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, since politics uses the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what we should and should not do, the purpose of this science must encompass those of the others, so that this purpose will be the human good. In Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, the relationship between the highest good and the organization of the polis presupposes that",the good of individuals consists in each pursuing their own interests.,the highest good is given by the faith that the gods are the bearers of truth.,politics is the science that precedes all others in the organization of the city.,education aims to train each person's conscience to act correctly.,democracy protects the political activities necessary for the common good.,2017,88,CH,C,english
