QUESTION 130,"Pressure cookers reduce the time it takes to cook food by raising the boiling temperature of the water. Knowledgeable users of the appliance usually turn down the heat on pressure cookers after the vapors have started to escape. By lowering the heat, the flame is reduced, as this prevents",increased internal pressure and the risk of explosion.,expansion of the pan and disconnection from the lid.,loss of the food's nutritional quality.,deformation of the sealing rubber.,unnecessary gas consumption.,2020,130,CN,E,english
QUESTION 131,"Nanotechnology can be characterized when the compounds are in the order of millionths of a millimetre, as in the use of catalytic nanomaterials in industrial processes. The use of these materials increases production efficiency, consumes less energy and generates smaller amounts of waste. The success of this technological application is often related to increasing the speed of the chemical reaction involved. The success of the application of this technology is due to the realization of chemical reactions that occur under conditions of",high pressure.,high temperature.,excess reagents.,larger contact surface.,high activation energy.,2020,131,CN,D,english
QUESTION 132,"Traditional headphones transmit music directly to our ears. Models with noise-canceling technology, on the other hand, not only transmit music, but also reduce all inconsistent noise around us, such as the sound of airplane turbines and vacuum cleaners. Noise Cancelling headphones don't really reduce irregular noises like speeches and babies crying. Even so, suppressing the snoring of airplane turbines helps to reduce noise fatigue, a persistent tiredness caused by exposure to loud noise for hours on end. These devices also allow us to listen to music or watch videos on the train or plane at a much lower and safer volume. The noise reduction technology used in the production of headphones is based on which wave phenomenon?",Absorption.,Interference.,Polarization.,Reflection.,Diffraction.,2020,132,CN,B,english
QUESTION 133,"To ensure that electronic products are stored properly before sale, some companies use humidity indicator cards in the packaging of these products. Some of these cards contain a cobalt salt that changes color in the presence of water, according to the chemical equation: Description of the chemical equation: The reactants CoCl2 (blue solid) plus 6 H2O (gas) form, in chemical equilibrium, the product CoCl2.6H2O (pink solid) with a delta H (enthalpy change) of less than zero. How would you go about reusing a card that was already colored pink in a short period of time?",Chill it in the freezer.,I would spray it with water.,I would wrap it in aluminum foil.,I would heat it with a hairdryer.,I would wrap it in a paper napkin.,2020,133,CN,D,english
QUESTION 134,"Description of the comic strip: Composed of three comics. In the first comic, we see a man's legs and a cat approaching them. In the second comic, the cat is rubbing against the man's legs and makes the following sound: PURRR. In the third comic, we just have the cat with all its body hair bristling, and in the balloon we have its thought: I HATE STATIC ELECTRICITY. Why does the electrification illustrated in the comic strip occur?",Exchange of atoms between the pants and the cat's hair.,Decrease in the number of protons in the cat's hair.,Creation of new electrified particles in the cat's hair.,Electrons moving between the pants and the cat's hair.,Repulsion between electrical particles in the pants and the cat's hair.,2020,134,CN,D,english
QUESTION 135,"The enormous amount of waste generated by society's growing consumption is causing socio-environmental concern, especially with regard to the amount of waste produced. In addition to recycling and reuse, quality of life can be further improved by replacing conventional polymers with biodegradable polymers. These polymers have major socio-environmental advantages over conventional polymers because",are not toxic.,do not need to be recycled.,do not cause environmental pollution when disposed of.,are degraded in a much shorter time than conventional ones.,have mechanical properties similar to conventional ones.,2020,135,CN,D,english
