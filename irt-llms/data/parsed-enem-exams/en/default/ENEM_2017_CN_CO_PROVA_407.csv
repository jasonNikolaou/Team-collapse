QUESTÃO 128,"Chemistry, the global science Ozonolysis, a reaction used in the wood industry to produce paper, is also used on a laboratory scale to synthesize aldehydes and ketones. The double bonds of alkenes are cleaved by oxidation with ozone (O 3), in the presence of water and zinc metal, and the reaction produces aldehydes and/or ketones, depending on the degree of substitution of the double bond. Disubstituted double bonds generate ketones, while terminal or monosubstituted double bonds give rise to aldehydes, as shown in the diagram. Description of the diagram: The reagent but-1-ene (a hydrocarbon made up of four carbon atoms with a double bond between the first and second carbon atoms) reacts with ozone (O 3) in the presence of water (H2O) and zinc metal (Zn), and produces propanal (carbon linked to oxygen via a double bond and linked to a hydrogen atom and an ethyl group via single bonds) and methanal (carbon linked to oxygen via a double bond and to two hydrogen atoms via single bonds). Consider the ozonolysis of the compound 1-phenyl-2-methylprop-1-ene: Description of the compound 1-phenyl-2-methylprop-1-ene: Carbon chain containing three carbon atoms with a double bond between the first and second carbons, a benzene ring on the first carbon and a methyl group on the second carbon. What are the products formed in this reaction?",Benzaldehyde and propanone.,Propanal and benzaldehyde.,2-phenyl-ethanal and methanal.,Benzene and propanona.,Benzaldehyde and ethanal.,2017,128,CN,A,english
QUESTÃO 129,"Cell therapy has been widely touted as revolutionary because it allows tissues to be regenerated from new cells. However, the technique of introducing new cells into tissue to treat illnesses in individuals was already routinely applied in hospitals.What technique is the text referring to?",Vaccine.,Biopsy.,Hemodialysis.,Chemotherapy.,Blood transfusion.,2017,129,CN,E,english
QUESTION 130,"In some homes, electrified fences are used to keep out potential intruders. An electrified fence works with an electrical potential difference of approximately 10,000 volts.  For it to be non-lethal, the current that can be transmitted through a person must not be greater than 0.01 ampere. The electrical resistance between a person's hands and feet is in the order of 1,000 ohms. For the current not to be lethal to a person touching the electrified fence, the voltage generator must have an internal resistance which, in relation to that of the human body, is",practically nothing.,approximately equal.,thousands of times bigger.,in the order of 10 times greater.,in the order of 10 times less.,2017,130,CN,C,english
QUESTION 131,"To light a fire or a wood-burning stove, it is recommended to first use dry leaves or wood chips and only then add the thicker logs. Considering identical reaction conditions, it can be seen that the leaves or chips burn at a faster rate than the logs.",pressure.,temperature.,activation energy.,contact surface.,concentration of the reagents.,2017,131,CN,D,english
QUESTION 132,"Some plant species have seed coats that are impermeable to water. Frequent fires during droughts cause a sudden and rapid rise in temperature, which can lead to the appearance of cracks in the seed coat and thus make it permeable, favoring germination. This is an adaptive characteristic of plants typical of which Brazilian biome?",Cocais.,Pampa.,Closed.,Restinga.,Caatinga.,2017,132,CN,C,english
QUESTION 133,"The periodic table In the air we breathe there are so-called ""inert gases"". They have curious Greek names, meaning ""the New"", ""the Hidden"", ""the Inactive"". And in fact they are so inert, so content in their condition, that they don't interfere in any chemical reaction, they don't combine with any other element and precisely for this reason they remained unobserved for centuries: it was only in 1962 that a chemist, after long and ingenious efforts, managed to force ""the Foreigner"" (xenon) to combine fleetingly with the eager and vivacious fluorine, and the feat seemed so extraordinary that he was awarded the Nobel Prize. What property of fluorine justifies its choice as a reagent for the process mentioned?",Density.,Conductance.,Electronegativity.,Nuclear stability.,Boiling temperature.,2017,133,CN,C,english
QUESTION 134,"The manual supplied by the manufacturer of a 220-volt electric shower shows a graph of the variation in water temperature as a function of flow rate for two conditions (warm and super-hot). In the super-hot condition, the power dissipated is 6,500 watts. Consider the specific heat of water to be 4 200 joules per, open parenthesis, kilogram times degrees Celsius, close parenthesis , and the density of water to be 1 kilogram per liter . Graph description: - Graph of temperature variation (vertical axis, in degrees Celsius) as a function of water flow rate (horizontal axis, in liters per minute). - For the warm position, at a flow rate of 3 liters per minute, the temperature varies by 12 degrees Celsius and, at a flow rate of 8 liters per minute, the temperature varies by 4 degrees Celsius. - For the super-hot position, at a flow rate of 3 liters per minute, the temperature varies by 32 degrees Celsius and, at a flow rate of 8 liters per minute, the temperature varies by 12 degrees Celsius. Based on the information given, the power in the lukewarm condition corresponds to what fraction of the power in the super-hot condition?",One third.,One fifth.,Three-fifths.,Three eighths.,Five eighths.,2017,134,CN,D,english
QUESTION 135,"The retina is a light-sensitive tissue located at the back of the eye, where the process of image formation takes place. This tissue is home to several specific cell types. One of these cell types is the cones, which convert the different wavelengths of visible light into electrical signals that are transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. In relation to vision, the degeneration of this cell type will",compromising the ability to see in color.,prevent the projection of light rays onto the retina.,cause the formation of inverted images on the retina.,cause difficulty in visualizing nearby objects.,loss of the ability to change the diameter of the pupil.,2017,135,CN,A,english
