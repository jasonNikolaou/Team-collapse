QUESTÃO 171,"A digital marketing team was hired to increase sales of a product offered on an e-commerce website. To do this, they created an advertisement which, when the customer clicks on it, takes them to the product's sales page. This ad was shared on two social networks, A and B, and the following results were obtained: - social network A: the ad was viewed by 3,000 people; 10 percent of them clicked on the ad and were redirected to the website; 3 percent of those who clicked on the ad bought the product.
