QUESTION 91,"The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi , which causes Chagas disease, could be medicine's new weapon against cancer. Brazilian researchers have managed to create a vaccine against the disease using a variation of the protozoan that is incapable of triggering the disease (non-pathogenic). To do this, they made a genetic modification creating a T. cruzi capable of also producing molecules manufactured by tumor cells. When the body begins to fight the protozoan, it also comes into contact with the tumor molecule, which is also seen by the immune system as an indicator of protozoan cells. Once the defenses have been induced, they start to destroy all the cells with the tumor molecule, as if they were only fighting the protozoan. What is the mechanism used in the experiment to trick the defense cells into attacking the tumor?",Hypersensitivity.,Triggering of an anti-inflammatory process.,Autoimmunity.,Activation of the innate response.,Presentation of specific antigen.,2022,91,CN,E,english,"['B', 'E', 'A', 'C', 'D']"

To lessen the impact of a crash, a tire barrier can be placed on the wall, making the collision take longer and the car return at a reduced speed. Another option is to place a barrier made of blocks of a material that deforms, making it just as time-consuming as the collision with the tires, but which does not allow the car to return after the collision. Comparing the two situations, what are the average force exerted on the car and the mechanical energy dissipated?","The force is greater in the collision with the tire barrier, and the energy dissipated is greater in the collision with the block barrier.","The force is greater in the collision with the block barrier, and the energy dissipated is greater in the collision with the tire barrier.","The force is greater in the collision with the tire barrier, and the energy dissipated is greater in the collision with the tire barrier.","The force is greater in the collision with the block barrier, and the energy dissipated is the same in both situations.","The force is greater in the collision with the block barrier, and the energy dissipated is greater in the collision with the block barrier.",2022,121,CN,A,english,"['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E']"

QUESTÃO 129,"Principles of chemistry: questioning modern life and the environment Uranium is used as an energy source in nuclear reactors. To do this, its mineral must be refined, converted to uranium hexafluoride and then enriched to increase the abundance of a specific isotope - uranium-235 - from 0.7 percent to 3 percent. One form of enrichment uses the small difference in mass between uranium-235 and uranium-238 hexafluorides to separate them by effusion, preceded by vaporization. These vapors must repeatedly effuse thousands of times through porous barriers formed by screens with a large number of small holes.
