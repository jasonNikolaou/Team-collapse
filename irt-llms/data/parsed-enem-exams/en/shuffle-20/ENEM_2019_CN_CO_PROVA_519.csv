QUESTION 91,"Most people's vision blurs when they open their eyes underwater. But there is one exception: the Moken people, who inhabit the coast of Thailand.  This characteristic is mainly due to the adaptability of the eye and the plasticity of the brain, which means that you too, with some training, could see relatively well underwater. Studies have shown that the pupils of moken eyes are significantly reduced underwater, causing light rays to fall almost parallel to the optical axis of the pupil. The visual acuity associated with the reduction in pupils is physically explained by the decrease in",the diffraction of light beams passing through the pupil.,from the reflections of light beams inside the eye.,of the light intensity incident on the retina.,the intensity of light beams in one direction by polarization.,the deviation of refracted light beams inside the eye.,2019,91,CN,E,english,"['B', 'E', 'A', 'C', 'D']"

QUESTION 93,"A simple experiment, which can be carried out with materials found at home, is carried out as follows: a volume of ethanol is added to a glass beaker and then a sheet of paper. Over time, a peculiar behavior is observed: the ethanol moves over the surface of the paper, overcoming gravity which attracts it in the opposite direction, as shown in the image. For some students, this is due to the liquid being absorbed by the paper. Image description: A glass beaker containing about a quarter of its volume of ethanol, in which a rectangular piece of filter paper is vertically immersed, resting against the bottom of the beaker. It can be seen that the ethanol wets the filter paper above the level of the liquid, near the middle of the beaker.

QUESTION 94,"Treatise on light When one considers the extreme speed with which light spreads everywhere and that, when coming from different places, even totally opposite ones, [the luminous rays] pass through each other without getting in the way, one understands that, when we see a luminous object, this could not occur by the transport of a matter that comes from the object to us, as an arrow or bullet passes through the air; for surely this is quite repugnant to these two properties of light, especially the latter. What concept does the text challenge about the behavior of light?","The belief in the infinite speed of light, defended by most Greek philosophers.","The wave model for light, which considers the possibility of interference between light beams.","The understanding that light needs a means of propagation, spread by the defenders of the existence of the ether.",The idea defended by the Greeks that light was produced by the eyes.,"The corpuscular model defended by Newton, which describes light as a bundle of particles.",2019,94,CN,E,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'C']"

Below the triangles are 3 overlapping squares (numbered 1 to 3, from left to right, and the same width as the base of the right-angled triangles). Between squares 1 and 2 and between squares 2 and 3 there is a gray area corresponding to the 20 percent frontal overlap. The UAV operator receives an order in which the images must have a frontal overlap of 20 percent on flat terrain.

QUESTION 105,"In 1808, Dalton published his famous book entitled A New System of Chemical Philosophy, which contained the five postulates that served as the foundation of the first atomic theory of matter based on the scientific method.

(4) Atoms are indestructible and in chemical reactions they retain their identities. (5) Atoms of elements combine with atoms of other elements in small whole number ratios to form compounds.

When preparing the second stage, he considers the acceleration of gravity to be 10 meters per second squared and the linear velocity of the disc's center of mass to be negligible compared to the angular velocity. He then measures the height of the top of the disk in relation to the ground at the lowest point of its trajectory, obtaining a third of the height of the toy's stem. The specifications for the size of the toy, i.e. its length, width and height, as well as the mass of its metal disk, were found by the student in the manual clipping illustrated below.

QUESTION 121,"Because they have a complete valence layer, high ionization energy and practically zero electronic affinity, it was considered for a long time that the noble gases would not form chemical compounds. However, in 1962, the reaction between xenon (valence layer 5 s two, 5 p six) and platinum hexafluoride was successfully carried out and, since then, more new noble gas compounds have been synthesized.  These compounds demonstrate that one cannot uncritically accept the octet rule, which considers that, in a chemical bond, atoms tend to acquire stability by assuming the electronic configuration of a noble gas. Among the known compounds, one of the most stable is xenon difluoride, in which two atoms of the halogen fluorine (valence shell 2 s two, 2 p five) covalently bond to the noble gas atom to give them eight valence electrons. When writing the Lewis formula of the xenon compound mentioned, how many electrons in the valence shell will there be on the noble gas atom?",6,8,12,10,14,2019,121,CN,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 122,"Space junk In the early hours of March 11, 1978, parts of a Soviet rocket re-entered the atmosphere above the city of Rio de Janeiro and fell into the Atlantic Ocean.

QUESTION 126,"The time-of-flight mass spectrometer is a device used to measure the mass of ions.  In it, an ion of electric charge q is launched into a region of constant magnetic field B vector , describing a helical trajectory, as shown in the figure. This trajectory is formed by the composition of a uniform circular movement in the yz plane and a translation along the x axis.  The advantage of this device is that the angular velocity of the ion's helical movement is independent of its initial velocity. The device then measures the flight time t for N turns of the ion. Therefore, based on the values q, B, N and t , the mass of the ion can be determined. Figure description: A system of three Cartesian axes (x, y, z) in which there are magnetic field lines (vector B) arranged parallel to the x axis (perpendicular to the yz plane). A positive point charge q is making several helical turns around the magnetic field lines B, moving in the positive direction of the x-axis.

QUESTION 128,"Concrete used in construction is a material made up of cement mixed with sand, gravel and water. Sand is usually extracted from riverbeds and gravel from the fragmentation of rocks. The environmental impacts generated by the use of concrete are associated with the extraction of mineral resources and the indiscriminate disposal of this material.

QUESTION 129,"Agoutis, small rodents from tropical areas, carry seeds that fall from trees in their mouths, but instead of eating them, they bury them elsewhere. This procedure allows them to save most of their buried seeds for the drier seasons, when there are no ripe fruits available. Scientists have discovered that agoutis steal seeds buried by others, and this ""thieving"" behavior means that the same seed can be buried dozens of times. This ""thieving"" is associated with the relationship of",competition.,alism.,symphilia.,parasitism.,predatism.,2019,129,CN,A,english,"['D', 'E', 'A', 'C', 'B']"

QUESTION 131,"Using coffee roasting waste in agriculture to replace conventional fertilizer Each harvest, the amount of coffee processed is equal to the amount of waste generated by its processing. The residue can be used as fertilizer because it contains around 6.5 percent pectin (a polysaccharide), approximately 25 percent fermentable sugars (fructose, sucrose and galactose), as well as residues of alkaloids (amino compounds) that were not extracted in the process.
