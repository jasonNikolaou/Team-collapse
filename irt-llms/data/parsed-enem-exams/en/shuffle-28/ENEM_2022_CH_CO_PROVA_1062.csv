QUESTION 46,"Empedocles establishes four bodily elements - fire, air, water and earth - which are eternal and change by increasing and decreasing through mixing and separation; but the principles themselves, by which they are moved, are Love and Hate. For it is necessary that the elements remain alternately in motion, being sometimes mixed by Love and sometimes separated by Hate. The text proposes a reflection on Empedocles' understanding of the arché, a typical concern of pre-Socratic thought, because",evokes the cosmogonic discussion.,exalts philosophical inquiry.,underlies human passions.,corresponds to the mythological explanation.,transcends the sensible world.,2022,46,CH,A,english,"['C', 'A', 'D', 'E', 'B']"
QUESTION 47,"Urban macrocephaly can be understood as the massive concentration of economic activities in a few metropolises, which triggers uncoordinated processes: redirection and convergence of migratory flows, a deficit in the number of jobs, disorderly occupation of certain regions of the city and stigmatization of social strata, all of which substantially compromise urban public safety.

The Mayans had been great astronomers, measuring time and space with astonishing precision, and had discovered the value of the number zero before any people in history. In the museum in Lima, you can see hundreds of skulls that were given gold and silver plates by the Inca surgeons. The aforementioned societies left behind a diversity of",war materials looted in colonial battles.,labor customs modeled on foreign styles.,cultural heritage made up of their own knowledge.,medicinal practices based on scientific knowledge.,religious goods inspired by the Christian matrix.,2022,49,CH,C,english,"['B', 'D', 'C', 'E', 'A']"
QUESTION 50,"In Vitória (ES), in the Goiabeiras neighborhood, we find the paneleiras, women who are known for their knowledge of traditional clay pots, icons of Espírito Santo cuisine. The tradition passed down from mother to daughter is of indigenous origin and has been influenced by other ethnic groups, such as Afro and Luso. From this mixture, it is believed that the manufacture of clay pots is already 400 years old. The manufacture of clay pots takes place in several stages, from obtaining the raw materials to making the pots. The raw materials traditionally used come from the natural environment, such as: clay, taken from the clay pit in the Mulembá Valley; wood, currently from construction waste; and paint, extracted from the bark of the mangrove, the popular red mangrove. A characteristic of traditional practices such as the one exemplified in the text is the link between the resources of the natural world and the",updating the management model.,conservation of the plantations.,specialization in the production stages.,maintaining ways of life.,participation in consumer society.,2022,50,CH,D,english,"['C', 'B', 'E', 'A', 'D']"

QUESTION 52,"Born in Lebanon, the two sisters could not be registered in the country, because it is required that children born in Lebanon be born to Lebanese fathers and mothers. Their parents, of Syrian nationality, were also unable to register them in their country of origin. In Syria, children are only registered by officially married parents, which was not their case. In situations like the one presented in the text, when people are born they are already in the socio-political condition of",stateless.,refugees.,exiled.,fugitives.,clandestine.,2022,52,CH,A,english,"['B', 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 53,"TEXT 1 A philosophy of perception that wants to relearn how to see the world will restore painting and the arts in general to their true place.  TEXT 2 The great film authors seemed to us to be confrontable not only with painters, architects and musicians, but also with thinkers. They think with images rather than concepts.

Neither on that day nor on the day of the floggings should anyone dare to throw apples, stones, oranges or anything else at the defendants. TEXT 2 As with all rites, the meaning of the auto da fé is given by the sequence of acts that make it up. The places, the postures, the gestures and the words are fixed in advance in all their complexity. For this reason, the auto da fé has strong moments - during the preparation, the staging, the act and the reception - which should be followed in detail. The rite mentioned in the texts demonstrates the Church's ability to",produce standards of conduct.,criticize discipline policies.,to encourage a desire for violence.,order heresy cults.,softening punishment ceremonies.,2022,54,CH,A,english,"['D', 'C', 'B', 'E', 'A']"

QUESTION 56,"Memories of a Bahian stool Today I am an inanimate being, but I once had life pulsating in plant sap, I was a living being; it's true that I belonged to the plant kingdom, but that didn't take away my perception of life lived as a stool. I cherish my creators, the hands that made me, sold me, and the women who used me for their sales and in so many other ways. These people did have their subjectivities, singularities and pluralities, which are incorporated into me. We need to consider that our history of museum furniture goes beyond the mere link to styles and the patrimonialization we receive as material goods linked to intangible heritage. Our history is linked to people's individual gifts and their social practices. Some individuals were renowned for having certain requirements, such as knowledge of classical models or drawing skills. By describing itself as museum heritage, the object discussed in the text associates its history with",anthropological and ethnographic nature of the exhibitors.,subjects' artistic and cultural abilities.,architectural and visual preservation of conservatories.,teachers' religious and pedagogical vocations.,economic and financial competence of traders.,2022,56,CH,B,english,"['C', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 57,"The advent of the Polis, the birth of philosophy: the links between the two orders of phenomena are too close for rational thought not to appear, in its origins, to be part of the social and mental structures of the Greek city. Thus placed in history, philosophy divests itself of the absolute revelation that was sometimes attributed to it, welcoming, in the young science of the Ionians, the timeless reason that came to incarnate itself in Time. The school of Miletus did not see the birth of Reason; it built a Reason, a first form of rationality. This Greek reason is not the experimental reason of contemporary science. The links between the phenomena indicated in the passage were strengthened by the emergence of a category of thinkers, namely:","The Sophists, committed to teaching rhetoric.","The rhapsodic poets, responsible for narrating the myth.","The Stoics, dedicated to overcoming misfortune.","The Epicureans, involved with the ideal of a happy life.","The Peripatetics, committed to the dynamics of teaching.",2022,57,CH,A,english,"['C', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'D']"

QUESTION 60,"The Kambeba people are the people of the waters. The elders say that the people were born from a drop of water that fell from the sky in a great rainstorm. In that drop there were two droplets: a man and a woman. ""It is because of this narrative and indigenous cosmology that we are the people of the waters that the river is of fundamental importance to us,"" says Márcia Wayna Kambeba, who has a master's degree in Geography and is a writer. Every day, she went with her father to observe the river. She would go in silence and, before she could speak, she would be interrupted. ""Listen to the river,"" her father would say. After about two hours of listening to the waters of the Solimões, she would dive in: ""Trust the river and learn from it."" ""I came to understand later, with my studies and experiences, that my father was introducing me to the ancient wisdom of the river."" From what is described in the text, the Kambeba people have the river as a",individual and ephemeral wealth.,listed and museographic object.,cultural and emotional heritage.,religious and sacralized heritage.,bucolic and scenic setting.,2022,60,CH,C,english,"['D', 'A', 'E', 'B', 'C']"
QUESTION 61,"Down there is the Itans Dam, with its anthills digging up the earth. The effort put in by the tinkling men in the sun, bathed in sweat, who don't stop, in long, patient lines accompanying hundreds of donkeys that go up and down in a moving, silent circle, each donkey with two boxes of earth on its back, is truly impressive. It's organized work for the salvation of the earth and of man. After the semi-desert that so grieved our spirits due to the lack of rainfall, the efforts of these thousands of sertanejos, all dressed in denim and wearing espadrilles, in a conscious fight against the sterility of nature, with their families housed in tiny mud and tile houses - the embryo of a future city - deeply impressed us. In the construction of the enterprise described, the presence of",workers in the formation of new spaces.,traders in the organization of commercial networks.,engineers in the construction of river channels.,colonels in the expansion of old farms.,workers in the distribution of water resources.,2022,61,CH,A,english,"['D', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'C']"
QUESTION 62,"For the colonial empires, the problem of diseases affecting slaves was something that masters faced on a daily basis. As a result, a series of works dedicated to the administration of slaves were published with a view to implementing modern slave labor management in line with the Enlightenment. In this context, medical knowledge played an extremely important role. It was seen as a fundamental tool for colonial development, given the perceived impact that tropical diseases had on the white population and enslaved peoples. According to the text, the importance of medicine was justified by the following objectives",naturalistic travelers.,emancipators of the metropolis.,traditionalists two natives.,of the elites.,abolitionists two lawyers.,2022,62,CH,D,english,"['B', 'E', 'D', 'A', 'C']"

QUESTION 64,"The basic principle of the rule of law is the elimination of arbitrariness in the exercise of public powers, with the consequent guarantee of individuals' rights vis-à-vis those powers. The rule of law means that no individual, president or ordinary citizen is above the law. Democratic governments exercise authority through the law and are themselves subject to the constraints imposed by the law.

QUESTION 65,"Brazilians take longer to get from home to work IBGE research shows that the situation is most serious in the Southeast: 13 percent of people take more than an hour to get to work. In the metropolitan regions of São Paulo and Rio, the IBGE recorded the highest percentages of workers taking more than an hour to get to work. Anyone who sees Marcelo arrive at work can't imagine the marathon he faces every day before 5 o'clock. ""I wake up at 4.30am, leave the house at 5am, take the train at 5.20am, arrive at Central Station at around 6.50am, take the bus and get to work at around 7.10am,"" he says.

QUESTION 66,"The story of the First of May in 1890 - in France and Europe, the first of all the Firsts of May - is exemplary in many ways. The result of a deliberate political act, this demonstration illustrates the voluntary side of the construction of a class - the working class - to which the socialists tried to give a political and cultural unity through that pedagogy of celebration whose principle, effectiveness and limits had long since been experienced by the French Revolution. Based on the text, the purpose of setting this commemorative date was to",valorize a bourgeois sentiment.,building a national memory.,assert a collective identity.,define a popular tradition.,create a civic community.,2022,66,CH,C,english,"['A', 'C', 'B', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 67,"TEXT 1 Brazil's first major educational law, from 1827, stipulated that in the Empire's ""schools of first letters"", boys and girls should study separately and have different curricula. In the Senate, the Viscount of Cayru was one of the advocates of keeping the math curriculum for girls as short as possible. In his words, the ""fairer sex"" didn't have the intellectual capacity to go very far: - With regard to maths, the four types are sufficient [for girls], which are not beyond their reach and can be of constant use to them in life. TEXT 2 In the Senate, the only person to publicly advocate that girls should have the same math curriculum as boys was the Marquis of Santo Amaro (RJ). He argued: - It does not seem appropriate, in the light of the times in which we live, to stop making it easier for Brazilian girls to acquire this [more in-depth knowledge of mathematics]. The opposition that is being expressed can only arise from the deep-rooted and terrible habit of the ancients, who didn't even want their daughters to learn to read. The speeches express divergent points of view, respectively due to the opposition between",domination of bodies and human equality.,exclusion of competences and political participation.,equity of choice and cultural imposition.,gender freedom and social control.,generating professional opportunities and restrictions.,2022,67,CH,A,english,"['C', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 68,"After seven years of occupying an abandoned plot of land in Santo André, in the ABC region of São Paulo, the Novo Pinheirinho and Santos Dias condominiums were inaugurated in the presence of representatives from the federal, state and municipal governments. The occupation began in 2012 and, since then, the movement has been demanding the right to use the space to build houses. Article 6 of the Magna Carta guarantees all Brazilians the right to housing.

QUESTION 69,"TEXT 1 The Navy identifies, in the voice of Thomas Barnett, a broad region that is potentially insubmissive or simply unyielding to the general operating rules promoted by the United States and sanctioned by the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank. And not necessarily because of their rebellious conscience, but in many cases because of the insubstantiality of their state institutions. TEXT 2 Image description: World map highlights locations identified as ""High germplasm density and variety"", ""Oil and gas"" and ""The critical 'gap' in the 'New Pentagon Map'"". The part of the globe identified as ""The critical 'gap' in the 'New Pentagon Map'"" encompasses extensive oceanic and continental areas in Central America, northern South America, the Caribbean, most of the African continent, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.

QUESTION 70,"Colleagues, in the minds and hearts of the people, Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia. This firm conviction is based on truth and justice and has been passed down from generation to generation, over time, under any circumstances, despite all the drastic changes our country has gone through throughout the 20th century. Considering the geopolitical dynamics underlying the text, the justification used by Vladimir Putin in 2014 for annexing this peninsula appeals to the argument that",Soviet imperialism had accommodated itself to the pretensions of the neighboring powers.,populations with a common language must be subject to the same state authority.,transnational organizations are incapable of resolving territorial disputes.,regional integration presupposes the free movement of people and goods.,the expulsion of Western naval forces would guarantee national sovereignty.,2022,70,CH,B,english,"['B', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 71,"Dubbing is the new field to be explored by artificial intelligence, and there are companies dedicated to transposing actors' original voices into other languages. The novelty reinforces the trend towards job automation in a wide variety of areas. It has the potential to make life easier for studios and production companies and, at the same time, make opportunities for voice actors and actors who work in this field more scarce. The consequence of the technological change presented in the text is the",stagnation of artistic expression.,valuing traditional culture.,reduced academic training.,protection of the national economy.,increase in structural unemployment.,2022,71,CH,E,english,"['D', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'E']"
QUESTION 72,"Brazil and Argentina reach agreement to cut Mercosur tariffs by 10 percent Brazil and Argentina have reached an agreement to reduce Mercosur's Common External Tariff (TEC) by 10 percent. The consensus was reached during negotiations between the Brazilian Foreign Minister and his Argentine counterpart at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia at the beginning of October 2021. Reducing the TEC is a long-standing desire of Brazil, which wants to open up its economy more and thus help control inflation. Argentina, on the other hand, feared that the measure could affect its industrial production. The agreement will cover a wide range of products and will still have to be presented to Paraguay and Uruguay in order to be formalized. The need for diplomatic negotiations to make this tariff agreement viable is explained by the following characteristic of Mercosur:",Dependence on agricultural exports.,Limitation of financial circulation.,Equivalence of labor legislation.,Standardization of monetary policy.,How the customs union works.,2022,72,CH,E,english,"['D', 'A', 'E', 'B', 'C']"
QUESTION 73,"Although the famine in Italy in 536 had its origins in climatic events, its implications were both political and economic. In the first centuries of the Middle Ages, aid to the hungry was part of the domain of public management, even when the actions of its agents were presented from the perspective of individual piety and charity, as was the case in Merovingian Gaul. Thus, the fact that responses to famine are shown in Gaul as the fruit of personal initiatives based on the imperative of charity derives from the nature of the 6th century sources. At the historical juncture highlighted in the text, the duty to act in the face of the crisis situation presented belonged to the jurisdiction","of the bishoprics, resulting from the participation of clerics in community affairs.",the concept of government underlying the Christian monarchy.,"of the nobility, stemming from the obligation to protect the free peasantry.","of the monasteries, resulting from the fraternal character affirmed in the monastic rules.","of the corporations, stemming from the welfare pattern laid down in the statutory rules.",2022,73,CH,B,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 74,"Tectonic forces within the lithosphere, controlled by the internal heat of the depths, generate earthquakes, eruptions and the rising of mountains.

QUESTION 75,"Image description: Infographic shows an upward spiral in the following sequence: HONEYMOON, TENSION, AGGRESSION, HONEYMOON, TENSION, AGGRESSION, in a recurring incidence, up to HONEYMOON, TENSION and DEATH. The caption of the illustration gives the following information: HONEYMOON: affection, passion, gifts, promises, reconciliation, freedom; TENSION: insult, humiliation, intimidation, shouting, threats, control, isolation, fear, conflicts, breaking promises; AGGRESSION: pushing, pinching, hair pulling, choking, throwing objects, slapping, kicking, beating.

QUESTION 76,"Surveillance and punishment: the birth of the prison Michel Foucault The leper is seen within a practice of rejection, of exile and enclosure; he is allowed to get lost inside as a mass that is not very important to differentiate; the pestilent are considered in a meticulous tactical policing where individual differentiations are the limiting effects of a power that multiplies, articulates and subdivides. The great closure on the one hand; good training on the other. Leprosy and its division; the plague and its sections. One is marked; the other is analyzed and divided. The exile of the leper and the imprisonment of the plague do not bring with them the same political dream. The authoritarian models described in the text point to a system of control based on:",The formation of a disciplinary society.,Hierarchization of the state bureaucracy.,Banishment of repressive authority.,Making social rules more flexible.,Condemnation of human degradation.,2022,76,CH,A,english,"['A', 'E', 'C', 'B', 'D']"
QUESTION 77,"TEXT 1 In March 1889, when the first pilgrimages appeared, attracted by the miracles of the Blessed Maria de Araújo, Juazeiro became part of the foundation of the religious space. Another center was being built, like Aparecida do Norte, Canindé or Lourdes. TEXT 2 We don't know for sure how many people were present in the chapel when the wafer bled from Maria de Araújo's mouth. Father Cícero tells us that the event surprised not only those present, but also the Blessed herself, who seemed stunned by it. The phenomenon continued to happen every Wednesday and Friday in the Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows from that day on. The cloths stained with the blood that flowed from the wafer and from the mouth of the Blessed Mother were at first kept by Father Cícero, but were soon exposed to public viewing and, furthermore, the bleeding was proclaimed a miracle without the knowledge and authorization of the diocesan bishop. The religious practices mentioned in the texts are associated, respectively, with:",Delimitation of urban landscapes and abandonment of spiritualist components.,Circumscription of symbolic goods and admission to ecumenical ceremonies.,Creation of mystical places and experiences of popular Catholicism.,Expansion of regional borders and the subjectivization of medieval Christianity.,Demarcation of affective heritage and appropriation of Judaizing elements.,2022,77,CH,C,english,"['A', 'D', 'E', 'C', 'B']"
QUESTION 78,"In 2003, the Food Acquisition Program began and with it several changes in the perspective of institutional markets. It is the first public procurement program with an exclusive focus on family farming, explicitly linking it to food and nutritional security.

QUESTION 79,"An experiment called FunFit was designed with the aim of getting members of a local community to become more physically active. All participants in the study were linked to two other members of the community who would receive small cash incentives to encourage them to increase their physical activity, which was measured by accelerometers in cell phones provided by the state. Thus, if the person walked more than usual, their acquaintances would receive the money. The results were astonishing: the scheme proved to be four to eight times more effective than the method of offering individual incentives. Contrary to the prevailing view of the impact of technology on human relationships, the text reveals that cell phones can perform a function",the choice of industrialized products.,"cognitive, favoring learning through virtual tools.","labor, converting the developer into the end user.","social, stimulating reciprocity through digital means.","recreation, promoting leisure in integrated networks.",2022,79,CH,D,english,"['D', 'E', 'C', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 80,"Rio de Janeiro's retail clerks were among the first categories of workers to organize themselves into associations and demand the intervention of public authorities in mediating their struggles for rights. In the 1880s, the clerks took part in the political arena and took to the streets with many others, such as republicans and abolitionists.

QUESTION 81,"Soils: formation and conservation Saline or allomorphic soils have the common characteristic of a very high concentration of soluble salts and/or exchangeable sodium. They occur in the lowest parts of the terrain, in arid and semi-arid regions and near the sea. In semi-arid regions, such as the polygon of droughts in the northeast of Brazil, the less elevated sites receive water that runs off the adjacent slopes during the rains that fall in some months of the year. This water contains solutions of mineral salts and evaporates quickly before infiltrating completely. Each time this process is repeated, there is a small accumulation of salts in the surface horizon which, over the years, causes salinization of the soil. In recent decades, the expansion of agricultural activities in the region has amplified this process. The agricultural activities carried out in this region intensify the environmental problem exposed by the",using irrigation systems without proper drainage.,"apply fertilizers of organic origin, modifying the chemistry of the soil.","installing weirs in the grottos, slowing down the river flow.","carry out pine forestation, disregarding the practice of fallow land.","deforesting permanent preservation areas, causing silting.",2022,81,CH,A,english,"['B', 'E', 'C', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 82,"TEXT 1 Image description: A cartoon shows a cell phone attached to the line of a fishing rod, protruding from the window of a wooden shack in a favela. A speech bubble reads: ""Are you studying, Junior?"". Another speech bubble reads: ""Calm down, I'm trying to find a Wi-Fi signal!"". TEXT 2 It's as if the problems were created by the pandemic when, in fact, this only shows how much they are trying to be naturalized. They were there, pushed under various rugs. Various surveys show that a significant proportion of students don't have access to the internet at home, they don't have computers; they have cell phones, but with cheap packages that don't allow them to attend all their classes. And if they do have cell phones and data, the question is: Is it possible to write a text on a cell phone? Is it possible to interact in a remote class on a cell phone?

QUESTION 83,"When the Madeira-Mamoré railroad was being built, what could be said about the patients, eternal moribunds wandering between feverish delirium, doses of quinine and the corridors of death? The Candelária Hospital was a sanctuary and a tomb, a monument to scientific progress and a preamble to darkness.

QUESTION 88,"Whenever the relevance of discourse comes into play, the issue becomes political by definition, because it is discourse that makes man a political being. And everything that people do, know or experience only makes sense insofar as it can be discussed.
