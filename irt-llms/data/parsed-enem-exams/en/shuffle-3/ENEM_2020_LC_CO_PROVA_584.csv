QUESTÃO 3,"Americanah Chimamanda Adichie Finally, Aisha finished with her customer and asked what colour Ifemelu wanted for her hair attachments. “Colour four.” “Not good colour,” Aisha said promptly. “That’s what I use.” “It look dirty. You don’t want colour one?” “Colour one is too black, it looks fake,” Ifemelu said, loosening her headwrap. “Sometimes I use colour two, but colour four is closest to my natural colour.” [...] She touched Ifemelu’s hair. “Why you don’t have relaxer?” “I like my hair the way God made it.” “But how you comb it? Hard to comb,” Aisha said. Ifemelu had brought her own comb. She gently combed her hair, dense, soft and tightly coiled, until it framed her head like a halo. “It’s not hard to comb if you moisturize it properly,” she said, slipping into the coaxing tone of the proselytizer that she used whenever she was trying to convince other black women about the merits of wearing their hair natural. Aisha snorted; she clearly could not understand why anybody would choose to suffer through combing natural hair, instead of simply relaxing it. She sectioned out Ifemelu’s hair, plucked a little attachment from the pile on the table and began deftly to twist. A passagem do romance da escritora nigeriana traz um diálogo entre duas mulheres negras: a cabeleireira, Aisha, e a cliente, Ifemelu.

QUESTÃO 4,"A Minor Bird I have wished a bird would fly away, And not sing by my house all day; Have clapped my hands at him from the door When it seemed as if I could bear no more. The fault must partly have been in me. The bird was not to blame for his key. And of course there must be something wrong In wanting to silence any song.

QUESTÃO 5,"A Mother in a Refugee Camp No Madonna and Child could touch Her tenderness for a son She soon would have to forget... The air was heavy with odors of diarrhea, Of unwashed children with washed-out ribs And dried-up bottoms waddling in labored steps Behind blown-empty bellies. Other mothers there Had long ceased to care, but not this one: She held a ghost-smile between her teeth, and in her eyes the memory Of a mother’s pride... She had bathed him And rubbed him down with bare palms. She took from their bundle of possessions A broken comb and combed The rust-colored hair left on his skull And then — humming in her eyes — began carefully [to part it. In their former life this was perhaps A little daily act of no consequence Before his breakfast and school; now she did it Like putting flowers on a tiny grave.

QUESTÃO 01,"El héroe de la família Héctor Sánchez Poco después apareció en casa de Elisenda Morales, arrastrando su cansancio y las contrariedades de un largo día que había dejado su ánimo en ruinas. A pesar de todo, supo resistirlo, y cuando ella le ofreció una copa de mistela, abandonó su asiento para ir hasta la tienda en busca de algo más estimulante. Allí, en el corredor de la casa, en taburetes separados, recibieron los primeros cálidos soplos de la noche. Con su habitual entereza, Elisenda entró a conectar la luz de la sala, sofocando parte de su reflejo, mientras comentaba que así estarían mejor. Al menos, pensó el tío Camarillo, no había sacado la lámpara como otras veces, ni le había entregado alguno de sus álbumes, y parecía en cambio decidida a mantener en ascuas al vecindario. Aquélla fue la primera vez que en mucho tiempo dejaron de lado el tema de las rentas, para entrar con pies de plomo en el espinoso terreno de las confidencias. No texto, no qual é narrada a visita à casa de uma personagem, a expressão “entrar con pies de plomo” é utilizada para se referir ao(à)",disposição para resolver problemas familiares.,cuidado para tratar de assuntos íntimos.,insensibilidade para lidar com temas do passado.,discrição para administrar questões financeiras.,determinação para conduzir discussões pessoais.,2020,1,LC,B,spanish,"['D', 'E', 'B', 'C', 'A']"

QUESTÃO 3,"La violencia como bella arte P ues bien, ‘Relatos Salvajes’, de Damián Szifrón, es sobre todo un brillante esfuerzo por poner rostro, por fotografiar, a la parte de la violencia que tanto cuesta ver en el cine. De repente, el director argentino coloca al espectador ante el espectáculo, digamos putrefacto, de una sociedad enferma de su propia indolencia, anestesiada por su ira, incapaz de entender el origen de la insatisfacción que la habita. ¿Cómo se quedan? Sí, estamos delante de la una película vocacionalmente violenta, obligadamente salvaje, pero, y sobre todo, deslumbrante en su claridad. Más allá del esplendor sabio de una producción perfecta, lo que más duele, lo que más divierte, lo que más conmueve es la sensación de reconocimiento. Cada uno de los damnificados, pese a su acento marcadamente argentino, somos nosotros. O, mejor, cada insulto proferido, y no siempre entendido, es nuestro, en algún momento ha salido de nuestra boca. O saldrá. La violencia no es sólo eso que tanto desagrada a los profesionales del buen gusto, a los programadores de ópera o a los filósofos de la nada; la violencia, la realmente insoportable, es también una cuestión de actitud, un simple gesto. Y esa violencia está por todas partes, está dentro. Y Szifrón acierta a retratarla tan fielmente que no queda otra cosa que romper a reír. Aunque sólo sea de simple desesperación. Brillante, magistral incluso. Nessa resenha crítica acerca do filme Relatos Salvajes , o autor evidencia o",autorreconhecimento diante dos diversos tipos de comportamento humano frente à violência.,cômico como fuga da sociedade diante de situações violentas.,estado de apatia da sociedade perante a violência rotineira do mundo atual.,empecilho para o espectador vivenciar a violência bruta na realidade e na ficção.,sotaque reforçado dos personagens a fim de marcar o espaço do cinema argentino.,2020,3,LC,A,spanish,"['E', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTÃO 4,"Los propietarios de la libertad Mario Benedetti Las palabras cumplen ciclos; las actitudes también. Sin embargo, cuando las palabras designan actitudes, los ciclos se vuelven más complejos. Cuando el hoy tan denostado Sartre puso la palabra compromiso sobre el tapete y hasta Mac Leish publicó un libro sobre la responsabilidad de los intelectuales, estas dos palabras, compromiso y responsabilidad , designaban actitudes que, sin ser gemelas, eran bastante afines. Salvo contadas excepciones, los intelectuales de entonces las hicieron suyas y, equivocados o no, dijeron sin eufemismos por qué empeño se la jugaban. Los intelectuales latinoamericanos también comprendieron dónde estaba esta vez el enemigo. Sólo entonces empezó la mala prensa. Los grandes pontífices de la propaganda subrayaron una y otra vez la palabra libertad y denostaron el compromiso . Libertad no era librarse de Batista o de Somoza, sino mantener la prensa libre . Libertad es la emocionada comprobación de que la gran prensa norteamericana es capaz de descubrir que Lumumba o Allende fueron liquidados por la CIA, sin poner el acento en que eso no sirve para resucitarlos. ¿Y compromiso ? Es la actitud que adoptan ciertos intelectuales, cuya carga ideológica perjudica notoriamente su arte. Después de todo, ¿cómo se atreven a frecuentar las provincias del espíritu, si es público y notorio que tales ámbitos son patrimonio exclusivo de los propietarios de  la libertad ? Transformar palavras em atitudes tem sido um dos grandes dilemas dos intelectuais. Ao ponderar sobre essa temática, o autor, um dos grandes críticos e literatos latino-americanos da atualidade, leva o leitor a perceber que",a complexidade relacionada ao conceito de liberdade impede o compromisso.,o compromisso político afasta o artista da criação.,o compromisso ideológico de alguns intelectuais está refletido em suas obras.,os intelectuais latino-americanos têm um posicionamento acrítico perante o poder.,os costumes sociais governam a linguagem e as atitudes das pessoas.,2020,4,LC,C,spanish,"['D', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'B']"
QUESTÃO 5,"Pablo Pueblo Regresa un hombre en silencio De su trabajo cansado Su paso no lleva prisa Su sombra nunca lo alcanza Lo espera el barrio de siempre Con el farol en la esquina Con la basura allá en frente Y el ruido de la cantina Pablo Pueblo llega hasta el zaguán oscuro Y vuelve a ver las paredes Con las viejas papeletas Que prometían futuros en lides politiqueras Y en su cara se dibuja la decepción de la espera. Rubén Blades é um compositor panamenho de canções socialmente engajadas. O título Pablo Pueblo , associado ao conteúdo da letra da canção, revela uma crítica social ao",usar um apelido jocoso para designar a atuação de um indivíduo em seu próprio bairro.,demonstrar que o problema sofrido pelo indivíduo atinge toda a comunidade.,contrapor a individualidade de um sujeito a uma estrutura social marcada pela decepção na atuação política.,relativizar a importância que se dá ao sofrimento individual em uma estrutura social baseada na exploração.,"descrever a vida de um sujeito que nunca resolve suas inquietações e, por isso, mantém-se silencioso.",2020,5,LC,C,spanish,"['E', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 6,"When it wanted to speed up the process of selecting new students, the traditional British medical school St. George's used software to determine who should be interviewed. By reproducing the way the staff made this choice, the program eliminated 60 out of 2,000 candidates. Only because of gender or racial origin, in a deduction based on surname and place of birth. A study on the case was published in 1988, but 25 years later, another study showed that this type of discrimination is still going on. The recent example involves Google's search engine: by typing in names common among blacks in the US, the chance of automatic ads offering criminal background checks can increase by 25 percent. And it can get worse with the question ""detained?"" right after the search word. The text allows society to be laid bare by relating information and communication technologies to the following",language.,education.,software agility.,prejudice.,over the years.,2020,6,LC,D,english,"['C', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'B']"
QUESTION 7,"In this advertising campaign, the image of the family and the verbal text come together to reinforce the idea that",the family that adopts is happier.,Adopting teenagers is simpler.,late adoption is very positive.,families prefer to adopt babies.,"adopted children are their parents' companions.

QUESTION 8,"I travel Curitiba of the positivist conferences, there are eleven of them in Curitiba, there are thirteen in the whole world; of the recorder player who hasn't turned the crank since the little monkey died; of the brave soldiers of the fire who drive by in the red car after the fire that nobody saw, this Curitiba and the one with the hot dog with double draft beer at Buraco do Tatu I travel. Curitiba, that of the Brave Donkey, a mysterious citizen died in Rosicler's arms, who was it? who wasn't it? it was the little king of Siam; of the Black Bridge at the station, the only bridge in the city, with no river underneath, this Curitiba I travel. Curitiba without pine trees or blue skies, for what you are - province, prison, home - this Curitiba, and not the other one for the English to see, with love I travel, travel, travel. The thematization of Curitiba is frequent in Dalton Trevisan's work. In the fragment, the narrator's relationship with the urban space is characterized by a view of","marked by negativity, which seeks to deconstruct the usual perspectives of representation of the city.","enraptured by the simplicity of the scenery, indifferent to the description of elements of recognized historical value.","full of melancholy, which notes the lack of cultural identity in the face of the impacts of urbanization.","devoid of affection, which ironizes the customs and traditions of Curitiba society.","distanced from the elements narrated, using the traveler's point of view as an expression of strangeness.",2020,8,LC,A,english,"['B', 'D', 'C', 'A', 'E']"

QUESTION 10,"The rats Dyonélio Machado - Do you think I have a money factory? (The director says these things to him, but looks at everyone as if he wants to give them an explanation. All the faces smile). When your son was ill, I helped him as much as I could. Don't ask me for anything else. Don't ask me to pay your bills: I already have mine, and that's enough for me... (Laughter.) The director's face is clean-shaven, his shirt is clean. The words have the polite tone of someone who lives with intelligent people, causeuse . Dr. Rist's face shines, red and glabrous. The other has his eyes on the ground, his attitude discreet. Naziazeno waits for him to turn his back, to resume the interrupted lecture, those observations on the social question, communism and integralism.

In this petition by the picturesque character from Lima Barreto's novel, the use of the standard norm is justified by",social situation of enunciation represented.,little representation of indigenous languages.,ironic attitude towards the language of the colonizers.,attempt to request the required document.,theoretical divergence between grammarians and literati.,2020,11,LC,A,english,"['A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'B']"
QUESTION 12,"Exergames lab: a complementary space for physical education classes Young people are currently immersed in a society permeated by technology. In this context, digital games are widely used artifacts. Active video games or exergames were introduced as a way of allowing the body to control these games. As a result, they have come to be seen as an auxiliary tool for adopting a less sedentary lifestyle, with positive effects on health. It has been argued that exergames can contribute to the regular practice of moderate physical activity, as well as promoting interaction between players, reducing the feeling of social isolation. On the other hand, it is argued that exergames cannot replace the real experience of bodily practices, as they do not motivate the permanent practice of physical activities in the long term. Because of their interactivity, exergames present themselves as a possibility for stimulating",the experience of systematic physical exercise.,"disputes between players, contributing to individualism.","physical exercise, promoting health.",game by means of commands provided by the video game.,involvement in physical activities throughout life.,2020,12,LC,C,english,"['B', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 13,"Why the stage-entrepreneurship industry will destroy you If, in the past, huge, seven-hundred-page books spat out formulas, equations and calculations that taught you how to deal with your company's cash flow, today they say: ""You'll get there!

Here, read the Blue Ocean Strategy. Do one more mentoring session, attend one more coaching session. The problem is that your mindset isn't right. You need to be more proactive.

QUESTION 18,"Travel reports: on the curves of the Nacional 222 in Portugal In April of this year, we went to Portugal for a month-long trip that we had been looking forward to for a year. On May 4, we arrived at Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport in Porto. What a beautiful ""ancient, very noble, always loyal and undefeated"" city Porto was! ""I was enchanted"", they would say... by the beautiful landscapes, historic buildings with beautiful façades, well-kept parks and squares. The tripeiros, synonymous with the people of Porto, are proud of their city, nicknamed Invicta - it has never been invaded. And they value all the good things there, such as ""the best road in the world"", the National 222. So on the morning of April 25, the day of the Carnation Revolution, we decided to visit this wonder. Every 10 kilometers we had to pull over: we ran, danced, drank hot chocolate, soup, anything warm. And off we went for another stage. A delicious adventure. After three hours - more or less twice as long as it would have taken if it hadn't been for the warm-up stops - we arrived home! Frozen, but amazed and undefeated! This text seeks to seduce the reader by exploiting an external voice about the historical identity of the Portuguese people. The passage that highlights this argumentative procedure is","""'I was enchanted', they would say... by the beautiful landscapes, historic buildings with beautiful facades [...]"".","""And they value everything that's good about it as 'the best road in the world' [...]"".","""The tripeiros, synonymous with Porto, are proud of their city [...]"".","""How beautiful the 'ancient, very noble, always loyal and undefeated' city of Porto is!"".","""On the morning of April 25, the day of the Carnation Revolution, we decided to visit this wonder.""",2020,18,LC,D,english,"['B', 'D', 'C', 'A', 'E']"

QUESTION 20,"Woman has clinically broken heart after dog's death As The New England Journal of Medicine explains, the patient, named Joanie Simpson, had signs of a heart attack, such as chest pains and high blood pressure, and had problems with her coronary arteries. When they did an echocardiogram, the doctors found the problem: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, known as broken heart syndrome. This medical condition typically occurs in postmenstrual women and can be preceded by a very stressful or emotional event. In these cases, the heart presents a transient dyskinetic movement of the anterior wall of the left ventricle, with accentuation of the kinetics of the ventricular base, according to a Brazilian medical article that reports a similar case. Simpson was sent home after two days and started taking regular medication. She told the Washington Post that she was almost inconsolable after losing her pet, a Yorkshire terrier. Recovered after about a year, she says she won't give up having a pet because she appreciates the companionship and love that dogs give to humans.

QUESTION 21,"Cases from Minas Olavo Romano Chiquito was almost thirty when he met Mariana at a wedding dance in Forquilha, where some of his relatives lived. He stayed there for a while. It hurt the girl, as they used to say, and they had to marry in a hurry. She lived with her father-in-law for a while, and they disagreed. It was just a matter of harvesting the corn and selling it. He moved in with old Chico Lourenço [his father]. He only saw his own smoke rise a couple of years later, when his father divided up the land. Being so similar, father and son never really got along. Each of them a bit more top-heavy, Mrs. Aparecida often heard her husband complain about their son's strong nature.

The UmLambePorDia hashtag project was born out of this intention: to bring more color and joy to the city through colorful lick-lambe posters. The idea came from writer Leonardo Beltrão in Belo Horizonte. ""In the midst of increasingly addicted gazes, we end up forgetting the beauty involved in every corner and the transformative power of the word itself."" So, every day a poster is put up to remind us to notice the city, the life that goes on around us and also ourselves. TEXT II Description of the poster: Poster stuck to a lamppost with the following text: ""Yesterday I went to sleep missing myself and today I suddenly came back"".

QUESTION 23,"Those in my street Ondjaki Life is sometimes like a game played in the street: you're in the last minute of a really hot game and you don't know that at any moment an older person might come along and tell you that the game is over and it's time for dinner. After all, life happens very suddenly - no one ever told us that this was the last Carnival in Vitoria. Carnival always came suddenly too. We children lived in a time outside of time, without ever knowing the real calendars. [...] The ""day before Carnival"", as Grandma Nhé used to say, was a day of confusion with clothes and paintings being prepared, dreamed up and invented. But when it happened, it was a quick day, because magical days pass quickly, leaving deep traces in our memory, which some also call our heart.

QUESTION 24,"In 2000 we had the first experience of women's soccer in a video game, Mia Hamm Soccer. Twelve years later, an online petition asked EA Sports to include women's soccer in Fifa 13. However, it wasn't until 2015, with a new online petition that gathered thousands of signatures, that women's soccer was included in Fifa 16. Seeing an untapped market niche, EA Sports produced the game with 12 women's teams and presented it as an innovation. The company knows that more than 40 percent of soccer players in the USA are girls. For them, seeing women's soccer represented in a video game is extremely important. Having women's soccer in Fifa 16 is a big step towards its popularization in the fight for gender equality, in a sexist, misogynistic and homophobic context. The electronic games present in youth culture can play a relevant role in the approach to soccer by",to overcome unsuccessful games released previously on the market.,innovate the sport by offering new games to the market.,"exploit previously ignored market niches, producing more profit.",reinforce male or female gender stereotypes in sports.,"spread a sport, promoting gender equality.",2020,24,LC,E,english,"['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'A']"

QUESTION 26,"In 2017, Leandro Aparecido Ferreira, MC Fioti, composed the song Bum bum tam tam, which generated 480 million views on YouTube in nine months. It is the most listened to Brazilian funk song in the site's history.  Based on a recording of the flute he found on the internet, MC Fioti did everything himself: he composed, sang and produced it all in one night. ""I started researching some types of flute, old stuff. And that's when I found the 'Sebastian Bach flute',"" he says. The discovery was by chance: Fioti didn't know who the German musician was and doesn't know how to play the instrument. The ""enveloping flute"" in the song is an excerpt from the Partita in A minor, written by the German Johann Sebastian Bach around 1723. The incorporation of an excerpt from Johann Sebastian Bach's work for solo flute into MC Fioti's music demonstrates the",the permanent influence of Eurocentric culture on Brazilian musical productions.,homage to the aesthetic references that gave rise to popular music productions.,interrelation of cultural elements from different realities in the construction of a new musical proposal.,unintentional use of music that is too far removed from the cultural reality of young Brazilians.,the need to disseminate concert music in popular circles on the outskirts of big cities.,2020,26,LC,C,english,"['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']"

QUESTION 32,"TEXT I Águas de Março Tom Jobim It's wood, it's stone, it's the end of the road It's a leftover stump, it's a little alone It's a shard of glass, it's life, it's the sun It's the night, it's death, it's the noose, it's the hook It's peroba-do-campo, it's the knot of wood Caingá, candeia, it's the matita-pereira TEXT II The most beautiful samba in the world The composer's sudden and certain inspiration also serves as an example of the old motto: nothing comes from nothing. Not even for Tom Jobim. Two sources are reasonably well known. The first is the poem O caçador de esmeraldas (The emerald hunter), by the Parnassian master Olavo Bilac: ""It was in March, at the end of the rain, almost at the entrance/ of autumn, when the earth in parched thirst/ had long drunk the waters of the season [...]"". And the other is a macumba point, successfully recorded by J. B. Carvalho, from Conjunto Tupi: ""It's wood, it's stone, it's small pebbles, the baiana spins over everything"". Combining Olavo Bilac and macumba would be good enough, but what we see in Águas de Março goes much further: everything is transformed into something else and another piece of music that recomposes the world for us. By situating the composition in the Brazilian cultural panorama, Text II highlights the following",relativization that the lyrics of the song promote in the traditional conception of originality.,innovative character with which the composer conceives the process of artistic creation.,uniqueness with which the composer converts erudite references into popular ones.,dialog that the lyrics of the song establish with different traditions of national culture.,the song's lyrics promote works that are little known to the public in the country.,2020,32,LC,D,english,"['D', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'E']"
QUESTION 33,"You feel like playing, but you don't know how to get your friends together? It's often difficult to find groups to have a ball with. As a result, apps are becoming available that bring teams together and reserve spaces for fans of the national passion. In one example of these initiatives, it is possible to organize a soccer match, sign up to take part in a game, rent pitches and courts and invite players. The app has two types of users: one who uses it as a group management tool, inviting friends to play, seeing who has confirmed and evaluating the matches. Another user is looking for matches near to where they are, such as people who are passing through a city. The interrelationship between technology and society has stimulated the creation of apps.

TEXT II The Young British Artists (YABs) group, which emerged in the late 1980s, has a diverse body of work that includes photographs, installations, paintings and dismembered carcasses.

QUESTION 35,"One of the strongest criticisms of the health-related fitness discourse is the eminently individual nature of its proposals, which serves to obscure other determinants of health. In other words, the individual is often presented as the problem and lifestyle change as the solution. It is also argued that the health-related fitness movement considers the existence of a homogeneous culture in which everyone would be free to choose their lifestyles, which is not true. The fact is that we live in a society divided into social classes, in which not everyone can afford to adopt an active and healthy lifestyle. There are structural inequalities with political, economic and social roots that make it difficult to adopt these lifestyles. Based on the text, the relationship between health and lifestyles",problematizes social organization and its impact on changing people's habits.,considers the homogeneity of individuals' choice of healthy habits.,constructs the idea that individual changes in habits promote health.,reproduces the notion that improving physical fitness through exercise promotes health.,reinforces the need to solve society's health problems through exercise.,2020,35,LC,A,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'C']"
QUESTION 36,"Portrait of a man Laís Corrêa de Araújo The landscape strict to the wall made vertebra by vertebra and dark. The generation of hair on the bark and the faces in their dykes of reposed shadow. The wells with their mud of anger and tension: between cement and forehead - a gap. The arrows throw themselves at the shores of no one, unharmed they retain themselves. Compasses of evasion between phalanx and street, probing naked solitude. And in the armor of something brackish, a single secret: all the pulp is the fruition of fear. In the poem, the lyrical description of the object represented is guided by a gaze that",contrasts emotional fragility with the excessive use of physical force.,reveals feelings of emptiness and anguish beneath the apparent austerity.,expresses disappointment at the possibility of overcoming suffering.,associates emotional incommunicability with cultural determinations.,privileges images related to the exposure of urban dynamism.,2020,36,LC,B,english,"['C', 'A', 'B', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 37,"Mr. Judge The instrument of the ""crime"" that is listed in this misdemeanor case is not a knife, a revolver or a pistol, but simply, doctor, a guitar. Is it a crime, after all, is it a sin, is it a crime of such vile horrors, to have a wretch wandering the streets, pouring out his sorrows in the squares? Tell him to be freed from his agony (his conscience tells us so). Don't stifle the singing that comes from the street, that comes from the night to greet the day. This is our appeal to you, in the certainty that you will accept it. We ask that it be added to the case file and that it be granted.

QUESTION 38,"Slam do Corpo is a meeting designed for deaf and hearing people that has been taking place in São Paulo since 2014. A pioneering initiative by the Corposinalizante group, created in 2008. (Before we go any further, it's worth explaining: the term slam comes from English and means - in a new sense for the verb usually used to say ""hit hard"" - ""poetry spoken in the rhythms of words and the city""). In the saraus, the first objective was to put the poems in Libras in the circle, to get the deaf to circulate and understand this encounter between poetry and sign language, to understand the meeting of these two languages. Self-written poems, three minutes, one microphone. No costumes, no props, no musical accompaniment. What counts is the modulation of the voice and body, the artisanal work of making the word ""visible"", in an arena whose main objective is to move the audience, to take the audience out of passivity, whether through humor, horror, chaos, sweetness and so many other sensations. In the artistic practice mentioned in the text, the body plays an important role in articulating different languages with the aim of",redefine the circulation space for urban poetry.,encourage authorial productions by Libras users.,give rhythm and visibility to poetic expression.,translating verbal expressions into sign language.,provide aesthetic performances by deaf people.,2020,38,LC,C,english,"['B', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 39,"It's possible to say that many idiomatic expressions transmitted by regional culture have anonymous authors, however, some of them arose as a result of very curious historical contexts. ""Aquele é um cabra da peste"" is a good example of these constructions. To understand this expression, so often repeated in the Brazilian Northeast, we need to look back to the 16th century. ""Cabra"" refers to the way Portuguese navigators called the Indians. ""Peste"", on the other hand, would be linked to the question of overcoming and resistance, or even an association with the devil. Over the years, this expression has come to be used to refer to anyone who is courageous, or even insolent, since it can be positive or negative. In fact, who hasn't been ""nhe-nhe-nhém""? The term, which usually means endless, monotonous conversation or grumbling, comes from the Tupi-Guarani language and ""nhém"" means ""to talk"".

QUESTION 40,"The gold of the 21st century Cerium, gadolinium, lutetium, promethium and erbium; sumarium, terbium and dysprosium; holmium, thulium and ytterbium. This list of strange and little-known names might seem like the line-up for a soccer team, which would still have lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, europium, scandium and yttrium on the bench. But these 17 metals, called rare earths, are part of the lives of almost every human being on the planet. Called by many the ""gold of the 21st century"", ""elements of the future"" or ""vitamins of industry"", they are in the materials used to make light bulbs, computer screens, tablets and cell phones, electric car engines, batteries and even wind turbines. Despite so many applications, Brazil, which owns the world's second largest reserves of these metals, stopped extracting and using them in 2002. Now it's thinking again about resuming their exploitation.

The mountains, rising menacingly from the earth, loomed darkly... The roads, stretching out over the fields, were animated like infinite serpents... The loose trees wept in the wind, like fantastic mourners of dead nature... The distressed night birds moaned ominously with funeral chirps.

QUESTION 42,"The sweat it takes to compete in high-level national and international competitions is the same for men and women, but the pay is often lower for them. If in tennis, one of the most gender-equal sports, all the major tournaments offer identical prizes for women and men, in soccer inequality reaches its peak. Neymar and Marta are two exponents of this national passion. She has been named the best female player in the world by FIFA five times. He won third place in the last vote for best player in the world. But it's in the bank account that the difference between the two stands out. Image description: A montage of photos, entitled: ""How much is the goal worth?"", shows two footballers, a woman and a man, with a partition separating the images of the two in the background. On the left side of the partition, in the foreground, is the following information about the player: ""Marta US$ 400,000 annual salary""; ""103 goals for the national team""; ""US$ 3.9 thousand per goal"". On the right-hand side of the wall, also in the foreground, is the following information about the player: ""Neymar US$ 14.5 million annual salary""; ""50 goals for the national team""; ""US$ 290,000 per goal"". Sport is a cultural manifestation in which social relations are established. Considering the text, soccer is a sport that",brings players remuneration commensurate with their efforts in sports training.,"is characterized by a masculine identity in Brazil, giving players higher pay.",is similar to tennis in terms of gender relations between men and women.,"results in better efficiency for women and, consequently, higher pay for female players.","has both male and female players with the same visibility, although there are prominent female exponents such as Marta.",2020,42,LC,B,english,"['C', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 43,"The longest bridge in the world Domingos Pellegrini We went to talk to the foreman, then to an engineer, then to a supervisor who sent for an engineer from our company. These men are from your company, engineer, he said, and they're asking for the bill. The company is committed to this bridge, people, said the engineer, you can't just leave. There was a circular saw cutting some rafters nearby, so you could only talk when the saw stopped, and that got on my nerves. I said that we had the right to leave whenever we wanted, and that was that. Then a guy with a jacket but no tie pulled up, the engineer kept talking and the saw was cutting. When he stopped talking, 50 Volts took advantage of the saw stopping and said that we weren't animals to work like that; then the supervisor said that, if it was a lack of women, they'd find a way. The engineer said that there were more than twenty companies working on the bridge, most of them at a loss, because it was more a question of honor, we had to finish the bridge, our company would never forget our work on that bridge, a national pride. The workers' demands regarding the demeaning working conditions to which they are subjected receive some attempts at neutralization from the employer's representatives, the strongest of which is the",intimidation by the discreet presence of a security officer at the scene.,promise to immediately satisfy the sexual needs of the workers.,an appeal for identification with the company that extends to patriotic love.,request in the name of damages and commitments to deliver the work.,sequence of assigning responsibility and decision-making power to third parties.,2020,43,LC,C,english,"['C', 'D', 'E', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 44,"Itinerário de Pasárgada Manuel Bandeira Vou-me embora p'ra Pasárgada was the longest-gestating poem in my entire oeuvre. I first saw the name Pasárgada when I was sixteen and it was in a Greek author. [...] This name of Pasargadae, which means ""field of the Persians"" or ""treasure of the Persians"", conjured up in my imagination a fabulous landscape, a country of delights, like the one in Baudelaire's L'Invitation au Voyage. More than twenty years later, when I was living alone in my house in Rua do Curvelo, in a moment of deep discouragement, of the most acute feeling of all that I hadn't done in my life because of my illness, this stupendous cry suddenly leapt out of my subconscious: ""I'm leaving for Pasargada!"" I felt in the roundel the first cell of a poem, and I tried to make it happen, but I failed. A few years later, in similar circumstances of discouragement and boredom, I had the same outburst about escaping from ""life as a beast"". This time the poem came out effortlessly, as if it was already ready inside me. I like this poem because I see in it, in outline, my whole life; [...] I'm not an architect, as my father wanted, I haven't built a house, but I have rebuilt and ""not in an imperfect way in this world of appearances"", an illustrious city, which today is no longer Ciro's Pasárgada, but ""my"" Pasárgada. The processes of communicative interaction involve the active presence of multiple elements of communication, among which the functions of language stand out. In this fragment, the predominant language function is","appealing, because the poet is trying to convince readers of his difficulty in composing a poem.","referential, because the text tells us about the origin of the name used in a famous poem by Bandeira.","emotive, because the poet exposes the feelings of anguish that led him to poetic creation.","metalinguistic, because the poet comments on the genesis and writing process of one of his poems.","poetic, because the text deals with the aesthetic elements of one of Bandeira's best-known poems.",2020,44,LC,D,english,"['E', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'D']"
