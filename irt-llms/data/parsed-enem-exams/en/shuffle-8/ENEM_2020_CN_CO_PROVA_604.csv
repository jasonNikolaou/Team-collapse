To carry out this experiment, the student placed a sample of PVC film in a test tube and heated it, promoting thermal decomposition. A majority of a heteronuclear diatomic gas was released, which was collected in a container attached to the test tube. This gas, when bubbled in a dilute alkaline solution containing an acid-base indicator, changed the color of the solution. In addition, when it came into contact with an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), it released carbon dioxide gas. Description of the chemical structure of polyvinyl chloride: the repeating unit of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) contains a carbon atom linked to two hydrogen atoms and another carbon atom, which in turn is linked to a hydrogen atom and a chlorine atom. This repeating unit occurs n times. Which gas was mostly released in the thermal decomposition of this type of plastic?",CO2,CO,HCl,Cl2,H2,2020,127,CN,C,english,"['D', 'C', 'E', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 128,"A population (moment A) is isolated into two subpopulations (moment B) by an isolation factor I. After a while, these subpopulations show phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that distinguish them (moment C), represented in the figure by the shades of color. The subsequent disappearance of isolating factor I can lead, at moment D, to situations D1 and D2. D1: The populations that were separated at the previous moment are now represented together, and in different colors, one portion white and the other grey. D2: The populations that were separated at the previous moment are now represented together and both have an intermediate gray tone.  The representation indicates that, at moment D, in the situation",D1 is a new geographic isolation factor.,"In D2, two populations with different phenotypic characteristics coexist.","D2 preserved the same phenotypic characteristics as the original population A. Figure description : The figure shows the characteristics of two subpopulations on a timeline. At moment C, when the characteristics are different, one subpopulation is represented by white and the other by gray. After the disappearance of isolation factor I, there are two situations at moment D:",D1 there are two populations separated by reproductive isolation.,D1 has a single population distributed along a gradient.,2020,128,CN,D,english,"['A', 'D', 'E', 'C', 'B']"
QUESTION 129,"In the pharmaceutical industry, the use of coating substances in oral medicines is very common, as they bring a series of benefits such as altering the taste of medicines that have a bad taste, improving the assimilation of the compound, among other actions. Some polymeric compounds based on the polysaccharide cellulose are used to ensure that the drug is only released when in contact with aqueous solutions whose pH is close to neutral. What is the purpose of using this cellulose-based coating?",Decrease the absorption of the active ingredient in the intestine.,Prevent the drug from being solubilized in the intestine.,Allow the active ingredient to be released by the action of salivary amylases.,Ensure that the drug is not affected by gastric secretions.,Facilitate the release of the drug by the action of bile salts on the coating.,2020,129,CN,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 130,"Pressure cookers reduce the time it takes to cook food by raising the boiling temperature of the water. Knowledgeable users of the appliance usually turn down the heat on pressure cookers after the vapors have started to escape. By lowering the heat, the flame is reduced, as this prevents",deformation of the sealing rubber.,expansion of the pan and disconnection from the lid.,unnecessary gas consumption.,increased internal pressure and the risk of explosion.,loss of the food's nutritional quality.,2020,130,CN,C,english,"['D', 'B', 'E', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 131,"Nanotechnology can be characterized when the compounds are in the order of millionths of a millimetre, as in the use of catalytic nanomaterials in industrial processes. The use of these materials increases production efficiency, consumes less energy and generates smaller amounts of waste. The success of this technological application is often related to increasing the speed of the chemical reaction involved. The success of the application of this technology is due to the realization of chemical reactions that occur under conditions of",high activation energy.,high temperature.,larger contact surface.,high pressure.,excess reagents.,2020,131,CN,C,english,"['E', 'B', 'D', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 132,"Traditional headphones transmit music directly to our ears. Models with noise-canceling technology, on the other hand, not only transmit music, but also reduce all inconsistent noise around us, such as the sound of airplane turbines and vacuum cleaners. Noise Cancelling headphones don't really reduce irregular noises like speeches and babies crying. Even so, suppressing the snoring of airplane turbines helps to reduce noise fatigue, a persistent tiredness caused by exposure to loud noise for hours on end. These devices also allow us to listen to music or watch videos on the train or plane at a much lower and safer volume. The noise reduction technology used in the production of headphones is based on which wave phenomenon?",Diffraction.,Interference.,Absorption.,Reflection.,Polarization.,2020,132,CN,B,english,"['E', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 133,"To ensure that electronic products are stored properly before sale, some companies use humidity indicator cards in the packaging of these products. Some of these cards contain a cobalt salt that changes color in the presence of water, according to the chemical equation: Description of the chemical equation: The reactants CoCl2 (blue solid) plus 6 H2O (gas) form, in chemical equilibrium, the product CoCl2.6H2O (pink solid) with a delta H (enthalpy change) of less than zero. How would you go about reusing a card that was already colored pink in a short period of time?",I would spray it with water.,I would wrap it in aluminum foil.,Chill it in the freezer.,I would wrap it in a paper napkin.,I would heat it with a hairdryer.,2020,133,CN,E,english,"['B', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 134,"Description of the comic strip: Composed of three comics. In the first comic, we see a man's legs and a cat approaching them. In the second comic, the cat is rubbing against the man's legs and makes the following sound: PURRR. In the third comic, we just have the cat with all its body hair bristling, and in the balloon we have its thought: I HATE STATIC ELECTRICITY. Why does the electrification illustrated in the comic strip occur?",Electrons moving between the pants and the cat's hair.,Decrease in the number of protons in the cat's hair.,Exchange of atoms between the pants and the cat's hair.,Creation of new electrified particles in the cat's hair.,Repulsion between electrical particles in the pants and the cat's hair.,2020,134,CN,A,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 135,"The enormous amount of waste generated by society's growing consumption is causing socio-environmental concern, especially with regard to the amount of waste produced. In addition to recycling and reuse, quality of life can be further improved by replacing conventional polymers with biodegradable polymers. These polymers have major socio-environmental advantages over conventional polymers because",are degraded in a much shorter time than conventional ones.,are not toxic.,do not need to be recycled.,do not cause environmental pollution when disposed of.,have mechanical properties similar to conventional ones.,2020,135,CN,A,english,"['D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'E']"
