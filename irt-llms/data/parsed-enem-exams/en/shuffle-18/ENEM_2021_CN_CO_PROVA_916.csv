QUESTION 126,"When setting up a kitchen for a restaurant, choosing the right material for the pans is important, because a pan that conducts more heat is able to cook the food more quickly, thus saving gas. The rate of heat conduction depends on the conductivity k of the material, its area A, the temperature difference delta capital T and the thickness d of the material, and is given by the ratio fraction of numerator delta capital Q and denominator delta small t is equal to k times A times fraction of numerator delta capital T and denominator d. In pans with two materials, the conduction rate is given by the fraction of uppercase delta Q numerator and lowercase delta t denominator equal to A times the fraction of uppercase delta T numerator and denominator (fraction of numerator df and denominator k1 added to the fraction of numerator d2 and denominator k2) where d1 and d2 are the thicknesses of the two materials, and k1 and k2 are the conductivities of each material. The most common cookware materials on the market are aluminum (k = 20 watts per meter per Kelvin), iron (k = 8 watts per meter per Kelvin) and steel (k = 5 watts per meter per Kelvin) combined with copper (k = 40 watts per meter per Kelvin).

QUESTION 131,"The simple act of not throwing used cooking oil straight into the garbage can or down the drain can help reduce environmental pollution. But what do you do with vegetable oil that will no longer be used? There is no ideal disposal model, but a simple alternative has been to reuse it to make soap.

QUESTION 132,"During human embryonic development, there is a communication between the right and left atria through the foramen ovale (or foramen of Botal). This communication does not cause any damage to the circulation of the developing baby, except if it persists after birth. Damage during the embryonic period is avoided because the fetal circulation resembles that of the","birds, because the small circulation and the large circulation are present.","amphibians, because differential pressures temporally isolate venous blood from arterial blood.","fish, because the circulation is simple, with a single passage through the heart.","crocodilians, because the separation of the ventricles prevents blood mixing.","reptiles, because the mixing of blood is minimized by a slow metabolism.",2021,132,CN,C,english,"['A', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B']"
QUESTION 133,"In hydroponic cultivation, nutrient solutions containing essential macronutrients and micronutrients are used. In addition to nutrients, pH is an extremely important parameter, since it affects the preparation of the nutrient solution and the absorption of nutrients by the plants.
