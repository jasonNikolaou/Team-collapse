QUESTION 46,"The expansion of cities and the formation of urban agglomerations in Brazil were marked by industrial production and the consolidation of metropolises as the sites of their development. In the second half of the 20th century, Brazil's metropolises spread over areas of continuous occupation, forming dense urbanized regions. The result of the geographical process described was",inhibition of inter-municipal consortia.,growth in outlying areas.,valuing the local scale.,predominance of state planning.,densification of rail transport.,2020,46,CH,B,english,"['E', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 47,"Image description: Representation of the grazing area and cotton and cereal cultivation in the agreste (1963). The figure illustrates the months of the year on three axes referring to bean, maize and cotton crops, indicating for each crop the conventions of grazing, planting and clearing, growth, bean harvest, green maize harvest, dry maize harvest and cotton harvest, presenting the following data: Grazing takes place in January and February in the bean crop, in January and February in the corn crop and in January and February in the cotton crop. Planting and clearing takes place in March and April for beans, March and April for corn and May for cotton. Growing takes place in May for beans, in May for corn and from June to October for cotton. The bean harvest takes place in June and July, the green corn harvest takes place in June and July, the dry corn harvest takes place from August to October and the cotton harvest takes place in November and December. The production dynamics shown in the image have as their central strategy the",intensification of livestock farming.,separation by soil type.,the time of nature.,prioritizing modern technology.,seasonal harvest exports.,2020,47,CH,C,english,"['E', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'B']"
QUESTION 48,"The world's demand for food production is steadily increasing at very high rates. Currently, in most countries, continents and regions, the water consumed in agriculture accounts for around 70 percent of total availability. In order to reduce the pressure on this natural resource, the expansion of agriculture requires improvements in",efficiency of irrigation techniques.,water runoff from the land.,artesian well maintenance.,speed of harvesting machines.,chemical soil fertilization.,2020,48,CH,A,english,"['D', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'A']"
QUESTION 49,"Hegemonies and emancipations in the 21st century, Ana Esther Ceceña In the case of the US Department of Defense, the emphasis is on outlining a general strategy for dismantling both real and potential enemies, as part of a preventive approach that assumes that the slightest dissent is a sign of danger and future war. We must have the capacity to respond to a conventional war as well as to confront a diffuse enemy, looking simultaneously at all the geographical areas of the planet. This is undoubtedly the most comprehensive strategy that has been developed to date. Taking the text as a parameter, what contemporary trend is driving the formulation of more comprehensive strategies by the American state?",Expansion of the democratic model.,Propagation of organizations in networks.,Eradicating conflicts in territories.,Projection of world diplomacy.,Elimination of regional differences.,2020,49,CH,B,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'C']"
QUESTION 50,"Planning stopped controlling urban growth and started encouraging it by any means possible and imaginable. Cities, the new message sounded loud and clear, were machines for producing wealth; the first and foremost objective of planning should be to oil the machine. The urban planning model discussed in the text is marked by",use of sustainable practices.,building social well-being.,the primacy of popular management.,expanding business participation.,sovereignty of government power.,2020,50,CH,D,english,"['B', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 51,"Ancient shields or crystalline massifs are huge blocks of ancient rock. These shields are made up of crystalline rocks (magmatic-plutonic) formed in Precambrian times, or metamorphic rocks (sedimentary material) from the Paleozoic. They are resistant and stable, but quite weathered. They make up 36 percent of the country's land area and are divided into two large portions: the Guiana Shield (north of the Amazon Plain) and the Brazilian Shield (central-eastern Brazil). The geological structures indicated in the text are economically important for Brazil because they concentrate",hot springs.,deposits of metallic minerals.,fossil fuel reserves.,rock salt outcrops.,agricultural limestone deposits.,2020,51,CH,B,english,"['A', 'C', 'E', 'B', 'D']"
QUESTION 52,"In The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Tolstoy describes in repulsive detail the terror of facing imminent death. Ivan Ilyich falls ill after a minor accident and soon realizes that he is heading towards the end in a way that is impossible to stop. ""In the depths of his heart, he knew he was dying, but instead of getting used to the idea, he simply didn't and couldn't understand it."" The text describes Tolstoy's character's experience of an inescapable aspect of our lives. This aspect has been a central theme in the philosophical tradition",in the discussion of the fluidity of relationships.,"utilitarian, in the sense of the rationality of actions.",in the context of historical materialism.,"logicist, in order to understand the facts.","existentialist, on the question of self-recognition.",2020,52,CH,E,english,"['D', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 53,"To say that the cartography of the modern era was part of the process of invention of America by Europeans means that the Amerindians' knowledge of the territory was ignored by European cartography or that they were deprived of their territorial representation and the authority that their knowledge had over space. In the analysis contained in the text, the cartographic representation of America was marked by",improving the concept of the border.,affirmation of forms of domination.,the accuracy of the demarcation of the regions.,advances in environmental studies.,assertion of native culture.,2020,53,CH,B,english,"['E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 54,"Democracy in America, Alexis Tocqueville The main characteristic of the Anglo-American social situation is its eminently democratic character. I said earlier that there was great equality among the emigrants who settled in New England. The influence of the laws of succession contributed to this. Established in one way, the laws of succession bring together, concentrate and group property and power into one. Established on other principles, they produce the opposite: they divide, share and disseminate property and power. The text discusses the role played by a rule in creating an environment conducive to",use of slave labor.,consolidation of bourgeois values.,containment of nationalist identification.,hierarchization of economic agents.,banning religious dissent.,2020,54,CH,B,english,"['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'C']"
QUESTION 55,"Politics, Aristotle We see that every city is a kind of community, and every community is formed with a view to some good, since all the actions of all men are carried out with a view to what seems to them to be a good; if all communities aim at some good, it is clear that the most important of them all, which includes all the others, has this goal more than any other and aims at the most important of all goods. In the fragment, Aristotle promotes a reflection that associates two essential elements to the discussion on community life, namely:","Rhetoric and language, because they deal with discourse in the agora.","Ethics and politics, because they lead to eudaimonia .","Metaphysics and ontology, because they deal with first philosophy.","Generation and corruption, because they encompass the field of physis .","Democracy and society, because they refer to social relations.",2020,55,CH,B,english,"['B', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 56,"Toyotism had a major impact on the Western world in the 1970s, when it was shown to advanced countries as a possible option for overcoming a crisis of accumulation. The organizational characteristic of the model in question, required in the context of the crisis, was the",expansion of large stocks.,matching production to demand.,increase in mass production.,centralization of the planning stages.,increased mechanization of work.,2020,56,CH,B,english,"['A', 'C', 'B', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 57,"Migration and contract labor in the 19th century, Marco Aurelio dos Santos The historical phenomenon known as the ""coolie trade"" was directly associated with the period from the late 1840s to 1874, when thousands of Chinese were sent mainly to Cuba and Peru and many abuses in labor recruitment were identified. The trade in coolies or, in other words, the transportation by coercive means of labor from one place to another, was compared to the African slave trade by many 19th century journalists and analysts. The comparison mentioned in the text was possible because of the following characteristic:",Offer of a formal contract.,Ethnic origin of the groups of workers.,Investment required from employers.,Oppressive control of individuals' lives.,Knowledge of the tasks carried out.,2020,57,CH,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 58,The physical aspects presented originate from the action of the natural force of,subduction of the ocean platform.,continental margin metamorphism.,collision of tectonic plates.,formation of mountain ranges.,refracturing from Earth's crust.,2020,58,CH,E,english,"['C', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'B']"
QUESTION 59,"The rehabilitation of historical biography integrated the acquisitions of social and cultural history, offering the different historical actors a differentiated, distinct, individual importance. But it was no longer a question of simply telling the story of the big names, in a hagiographic format - almost a saint's life - without any problems or blemishes. It was more about examining the actors (or the actor), famous or not, as witnesses, as reflections, as revealers of an era. According to the text, new studies have valued the history of the individual as a possibility of",adherence to the positivist method.,"interpretation of the manifestations of the divine. Image description : Cartographic representation showing the Great Rift Valley, which extends along the image, covering parts of Asia and Africa, with the indication of volcanoes along this valley.",access to the daily life of communities.,resgate of heroic narratives.,expression of the role of the elites.,2020,59,CH,C,english,"['A', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B']"
QUESTION 60,"Society as a just system of social cooperation is one of the fundamental family ideas that gives structure and organization to justice as equity. Social cooperation is guided by rules and procedures that are publicly recognized and accepted by those who cooperate as being appropriate to regulate their conduct. Cooperation is said to be fair because its terms are such that all participants can reasonably accept them, as long as everyone else does too. In the context of political thought, the idea presented is consistent with",understanding of modern contractualism.,critical positioning of socialism.,republican ideal of government.,tripartite chain of powers.,legitimacy of monarchical absolutism.,2020,60,CH,A,english,"['E', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'D']"
QUESTION 61,"In fact, until the destruction of Carthage, the people and the Roman Senate governed the Republic in harmony and without passion, and there was no struggle among the citizens for glory or domination; the fear of the enemy kept the city in the line of duty. But as soon as fear disappeared from the minds, the evils for which prosperity has a predilection were introduced, that is, licentiousness and pride. The historical event mentioned in the text by Salustius, dating back to I BC, corresponded with the process of",the imposition of debt bondage.,demarcation of public lands.,restriction of citizenship by kinship.,expansion of the extrapeninsular frontiers.,restoration of ancestral institutions.,2020,61,CH,D,english,"['B', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 62,"The seditious movement that took place in the captaincy of Pernambuco in 1817 was analyzed in different ways by two media outlets of the time. Correio Braziliense pointed to the fact that ""the commotion in Brazil was motivated by general discontent, and not by the machinations of a few individuals"". Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro considered the movement to be a ""one-off deviation from the norm, just a 'stain' on the 'pages of Portuguese history', so distinguished by the testimonies of love and respect that the vassals of this nation consecrate to their sovereign"". The fragments of newspaper articles about the event, although with different perceptions, relate to an aspect of the Portuguese-American colony's independence process expressed in dissent between",free men around the extension of the right to vote.,regional groups about the political-territorial configuration.,secular intellectuals about the revocation of ecclesiastical domination.,leading cadres around the abolition of the slave order.,local elites about the ordering of the land monopoly.,2020,62,CH,B,english,"['D', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'E']"
QUESTION 63,"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen - 1789 The representatives of the French people, considering that ignorance, forgetfulness or contempt of the rights of man are the sole causes of public evils and the corruption of governments, have resolved to solemnly declare the natural, inalienable and sacred rights of man, so that this declaration, always present in all members of the social body, may permanently remind them of their rights and duties; so that the demands of citizens, founded on simple and incontestable principles, may always be directed towards the conservation of the Constitution and general happiness. This document, drawn up in the context of the French Revolution, reflects a profound social change by establishing the",bankruptcy of bourgeois society.,suppression of constituent power.,maintenance of communal lands.,abolition of political parties.,parity of legal treatment.,2020,63,CH,E,english,"['C', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 64,"In Greece, the concept of the people covered only those individuals who were considered citizens. It is therefore possible to see that the concept of people was very restrictive. Even taking this into account, the form of democracy experienced by the Athenian Greeks in the 4th and 5th centuries BC can be fundamentally characterized as direct. In that context, the emergence of the system of government mentioned in the excerpt promoted the following",competition to choose representatives.,campaign to revitalize the oligarchies.,establishment of temporary mandates.,participation in the exercise of power.,decline of organized civil society.,2020,64,CH,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 65,"Two major historical events made a case like Menocchio's possible: the invention of the printing press and the Reformation. The printing press allowed him to compare books with the oral tradition in which he had grown up and provided him with the words to organize the heap of ideas and fantasies that lived within him. The Reformation gave him the audacity to communicate what he thought to the village priest, his countrymen and the inquisitors - even though he couldn't say everything in front of the pope, the cardinals and the princes, as he wanted to. The historical events mentioned above helped this individual, in the 16th century, to rethink the Catholic view of the world by enabling him to",popular acceptance of secular education.,baroque sophistication of the liturgical ritual.,public consultation of the royal libraries.,doctrinal correction of medieval heresies.,autonomous interpretation of biblical texts.,2020,65,CH,E,english,"['C', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 66,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass and other texts, Lewis Carroll ""I must be getting close to the center of the Earth. Let's see: it must have been more than six thousand kilometers, thereabouts..."" (as it turns out, Alice had learned a lot of things like this at school, and although this wasn't a very good opportunity to demonstrate her knowledge, since there was no one around to listen to her, it was good to practice a bit) ""... yes, that must be about the distance... but then what latitude or longitude am I at?"" (Alice had no idea what latitude or longitude were, but she thought they were very imposing words). The text describes the character's confusion about",the location of magnetic north.,to the contours of the time zones.,the type of map projection.,the distortions of continental shapes.,to relative position references.,2020,66,CH,E,english,"['C', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 67,"African prehistoric art has undoubtedly been a vehicle for educational and social messages. The San, who today are the people closest to the reality of rock art, claim that their ancestors explained their vision of the world to them through this gigantic book of images that are the galleries. The education of peoples who don't know how to write is based above all on images and sound, on audiovisuals. According to the text, the art mentioned is important for the peoples who cultivate it because it contributes to",the emergence of family ties.,disruption of hierarchical discipline.,rejection of exogenous practices.,transmission of accumulated knowledge.,expansion of individual property.,2020,67,CH,D,english,"['D', 'C', 'E', 'A', 'B']"
QUESTION 68,"A brief introduction to philosophy, Thomas Nagel Would things seem different to you if, in fact, they all existed only in your mind - if everything you thought was the real external world was just a giant dream or hallucination that you would never wake up from? If that were the case, then of course you could never wake up, as you do when you dream, because it would mean that there is no ""real"" world in which to wake up. So it wouldn't be exactly the same as a normal dream or hallucination. The text gives visibility to a contemporary philosophical doctrine known as:","Fallibilism, which rejects mental mechanisms to support an unequivocal belief.","Idealism, which denies the existence of objects independently of the work of cognition.","Falsificationism, which establishes cycles of problems to disprove a conjecture.","Personalism, which links the surrounding reality to the realms of the personal.","Solipsism, which recognizes cognitive limitations to understanding a shared experience.",2020,68,CH,E,english,"['C', 'D', 'B', 'A', 'E']"
QUESTION 69,"TEXT I TEXT II The River Tietê is dead. At least part of it: 137 kilometers, to be precise. A survey by the SOS Mata Atlântica Foundation shows that, in 2016, the stretch of the river with water quality classified as bad or very bad begins in Itaquaquecetuba, passes through the entire Metropolitan Region of São Paulo and reaches Cabreúva, in the interior of São Paulo. In this stretch, the water doesn't have enough oxygen to harbor life. Considering the analysis of the texts, the current condition of this river has its origins in",extinction of native vegetation.,"expanding use of chemical pesticides. Image description: Panoramic photo of a stretch of the River Tietê, bordered by buildings in the city of São Paulo.",valorization of the urban site.,receiving a dense load of waste.,disorganized capture of rainfall.,2020,69,CH,D,english,"['B', 'E', 'A', 'C', 'D']"
QUESTION 70,"An inquiry into human understanding, David Hume Adam, even if we were to suppose that his rational faculties were entirely perfect from the beginning, could not have inferred from the fluidity and transparency of water that it would suffocate him, nor from the luminosity and heat of fire that it could consume him. No object ever reveals, through the qualities that appear to the senses, either the causes that produced it or the effects that will come from it; nor is our reason capable of drawing, without the aid of experience, any conclusion regarding the actual existence of things or questions of fact. According to the author, what is the origin of human knowledge?",The revelation of divine inspiration.,Experiencing the phenomena of the world.,The development of abstract reasoning.,The innate power of the mind.,The study of philosophical traditions.,2020,70,CH,B,english,"['B', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 71,"TEXT I The increase in suspected cases of yellow fever in Minas may be related to the Mariana tragedy in 2015, according to Fiocruz biologist Márcia Chame. The hypothesis is based on the location of the towns in Minas Gerais that have so far identified cases of patients with symptoms of the disease. Most of them are in the region near the Doce River, which was affected by the collapse of the Fundão Dam in November 2015. TEXT II On the other hand, Servio Ribeiro considers the possibility of the Mariana (MG) tragedy influencing this yellow fever outbreak in Minas Gerais to be remote. ""Yellow fever is a forest disease. The mosquito that transmits it lays eggs in tree cavities and bromeliads. It's a forest structure mosquito. It doesn't have much of a relationship with large bodies of water or rivers. The towns affected by the disease are in a region where the tailings didn't hit hard enough to cut down the forest,"" says the biologist. With regard to the Mariana tragedy, the texts differ in terms of",the appearance of an endemic disease.,identification of the affected area.,the emergence of homeless communities.,pollution of local rivers.,destruction of native vegetation.,2020,71,CH,A,english,"['D', 'B', 'E', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 72,"The Amazon rubber tappers were invisible on the national scene in the 1970s. They began to articulate themselves as an agrarian movement in the early 1980s, and in the following decade they achieved national recognition, obtaining the implementation of the first extractive reserves after the assassination of Chico Mendes. Thus, in twenty years, the peasants of the forest went from invisibility to becoming a paradigm of sustainable development with popular participation. According to the text, the visibility of Amazonian rubber tappers was established by the relationship between",government incentives and land conservation.,rubber production and the scarcity of natural resources.,economic growth and the migration of workers.,land claims and preservation of native forest.,modernization of latex planting and trade.,2020,72,CH,D,english,"['D', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 73,"Because we all confess that we can't live without a few slaves, who fetch wood and water, and make the bread we eat every day, and other services that cannot be done by the Jesuit Brothers, especially since there are so few of them that it would be necessary to give up confessions and everything else. It seems to me that the Society of Jesus should have and acquire slaves, precisely by the means that the Constitutions allow, when it can for our colleges and children's homes. The text makes explicit the premises of Portuguese overseas expansion by seeking to justify the",propagation of Christian ideals.,valuing manual labor.,adherence to contemplative asceticism.,adoption of captivity in the colony.,literacy among indigenous people in the Missions.,2020,73,CH,D,english,"['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 74,"The cities of Puebla in Mexico and Legazpi in the Philippines have almost nothing in common. They are very far from each other and are inhabited by very different peoples. What unites them is a tragic detail of their geography. They were built in the vicinity of some of the world's most dangerous volcanoes: Mexico's Popocatepétl and the Philippines' Mayon. Their inhabitants need to be ready to run at any time. They are part of the 550 million people living in volcanic risk zones around the world. Contrary to what would be sensible, they remain there, indifferent to the danger that awaits them. The physical characteristic that justifies the fixation of man in the places presented in the text is the occurrence of",efficient drainage.,steep slope.,amenable climate.,only fertile.,diverse vegetation.,2020,74,CH,D,english,"['D', 'B', 'E', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 75,"Under a roof, their journey of faith began in the dining room. In the small Christian cell, meals were shared and during them believers talked, prayed and read letters from co-religionists living in different parts of the Roman Empire (2nd century of the Christian era). This environment provided a special emotional support for the intensely individual experiences it harbored. One reason for the setting of the practice described in the text can be found in","moralism of the legislation, which made it difficult for free youth to hold open meetings.","manorial violence, which led to the forced break-up of slave families.","Jewish rule, which preached the spiritual superiority of synagogue services.","political decision, which censored public manifestations of dissident doctrine.","adherence of the patriciate, which subverted the original concept of foreign values.",2020,75,CH,D,english,"['B', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'C']"
QUESTION 76,"The collision between a continental plate and an oceanic plate will cause the latter to subduct under the continental plate, which, like arches and islands, will produce a magmatic arc at the edge of the continent, composed of volcanic rocks accompanied by deformation and metamorphism of both pre-existing rocks and part of the rocks formed in the process. Which physiographic feature is generated by this tectonic process?",Sedimentary basins.,Modern folds.,Absolute depression.,Crystalline plateaus.,Abyssal plains.,2020,76,CH,B,english,"['D', 'E', 'C', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 77,"The Song of the Earth, Cora Coralina (fragment) I am the earth, I am life. To you, O farmer, all that is mine. Your plow, your scythe, your axe. Your child's tiny cradle. The cotton of your garment and the bread of your house. And one day, far away, you will return to me. And in the maternal bed of my peaceful breast you will sleep. Let's plant the field. Let's plow the field. In the context of the different ways in which land is appropriated, Cora Coralina's poem emphasizes the relationship between",landowners and soil fertilization.,indigenous people and agroecological management.,sharecroppers and division of labor.,peasants and the use of nature.,land grabbers and territorial control.,2020,77,CH,D,english,"['E', 'D', 'B', 'C', 'A']"
QUESTION 78,"Montaigne gave his name to a new literary genre; he was one of the first to establish a private space in modern literature, the space of the ""I"", of the intimate text. He created a new process of philosophical writing, in which hesitations, self-criticism and corrections entered the text itself. The new genre of writing alluded to in the text is the","meditation, which proposes preparations for knowledge.","confession, which recounts experiences of transformation.","letter, which communicates information to an acquaintance.","dialog, which discusses issues with different interlocutors.","essay, which exposes subjective conceptions of a topic.",2020,78,CH,E,english,"['D', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'B']"
QUESTION 79,"Salamanca Declaration - 1994 We believe and proclaim that: every child has a fundamental right to education and should be given the opportunity to achieve and maintain an adequate level of learning; every child has unique characteristics, interests, abilities and learning needs; educational systems should be designed and educational programs implemented to take into account the vast diversity of such characteristics and needs. As a signatory of the aforementioned Declaration, Brazil has committed itself to drawing up public education policies that take into account the",plurality of subjects.,creation of privileges.,containment of spending.,valuing meritocracy.,standardization of the curriculum.,2020,79,CH,A,english,"['C', 'A', 'B', 'E', 'D']"
QUESTION 80,"TEXT I The Herd Keeper, Fernando Pessoa (fragment) My thoughts are all sensations. I think with my eyes and my ears And with my hands and my feet And with my nose and my mouth. TEXT II Phenomenology of perception, Maurice Merleau-Ponty Everything I know about the world, even from science, I know from my own vision or experience of the world, without which the symbols of science could say nothing. The texts are aligned with an understanding of the idea of knowledge, from a perspective that supports the",anteriority of reason in the cognitive domain.,verifiability of propositions in the field of logic.,valuing the body in the apprehension of reality.,confirmation of the existence of innate knowledge.,the possibility of contemplating timeless truths.,2020,80,CH,C,english,"['A', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 81,"The International Division of Labor means that some countries specialize in winning and others in losing. Our region in the world, which today we call Latin America, was early: it specialized in losing from the earliest times when the Europeans of the Renaissance ventured into the seas and stuck their teeth down its throat. Centuries have passed and Latin America has perfected its functions. Written in the 1970s, the text considers Latin America's participation in the International Division of Labor as marked by",external dependence on food supplies.,imperialist appropriation of territorial resources.,gradually overcoming the agro-export character.,innovative production of technology standards.,economic valorization of traditional knowledge.,2020,81,CH,B,english,"['E', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 82,"The sixth Sumerian king (ruling between the 18th and 17th centuries BC) and born in Babel, ""Khammu-rabi"" (pronounced Babylonian) was the founder of the First Babylonian Empire (corresponding to present-day Iraq), largely unifying the Mesopotamian world, uniting the Semites and the Sumerians and bringing Babylon to its maximum splendor. Hammurabi's name remains inextricably linked to the legal code considered to be the most remote ever discovered: the Code of Hammurabi. The Babylonian legislator consolidated the legal tradition, harmonized customs and extended the law to all subjects. In this context of the organization of social life, the laws contained in the aforementioned Code had the meaning of",conferring political prerogatives on the descendants of foreigners.,typify rules regarding acts worthy of punishment.,granting pardons to prisoners of war.,ensure individual guarantees for free citizens.,promote land distribution to the urban unemployed.,2020,82,CH,B,english,"['E', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 83,"Since the ancient world and its philosophy, work has been understood as an expression of life and degradation, creation and unhappiness, vital activity and slavery, social happiness and servitude. Work and fatigue. In Modernity, under the command of the world of merchandise and money, the prevalence of business (denying idleness) buried the empire of rest, leisure and laziness, creating a positive work ethic. The process of re-signifying work in modern societies began with the emergence of a new mentality, influenced by the","strength of trade unionism, which emerged in the wake of anarchism, demanding labor rights.","hygienist reform, which combated the excessive and unhealthy nature of factory work.","Protestant Reformation, which expressed the importance of work activities in the secularized world.","women's participation in social movements, defending the right to work.","view of Catholicism, which had defended the dignity of work and profit since the Middle Ages.",2020,83,CH,C,english,"['C', 'A', 'B', 'D', 'E']"
QUESTION 84,"It is hard to imagine that in the 1990s, in a country with sectors of the population in absolute poverty and without a network of social benefits to fall back on, a government could abandon the role of promoting job creation programs, social assistance, infrastructure development and the promotion of excluded regions, in the expectation that the market would one day provide an adequate response to all of this. In this context, the criticized attitude of governments towards the country's social situation has coincided with the prioritization of what measures?",Democratization of housing credit and the acquisition of affordable housing.,Expansion of investment in public companies and state banks.,Reformulation of access to higher education and national scientific funding.,Reform of macroeconomic policies and inflation control mechanisms.,Reducing the individual tax burden and the corporate tax contribution.,2020,84,CH,D,english,"['B', 'A', 'D', 'E', 'C']"
QUESTION 85,"Although there is no denying the benefits that both economies have gained from trade, Brazil has reiterated its objective of developing a less asymmetrical trade relationship with China. The figures clearly reveal the asymmetry. Depending on the year, Brazil's exports of basic products, especially soybeans, iron ore and oil, make up somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of the tariff, while Brazil's imports consist of approximately 95 percent of Chinese industrialized products, ranging from the most varied consumer goods to high-value machinery and equipment. A long-term state action capable of reducing the asymmetry in Brazil's trade balance, as set out in the text, is the following",expansion of the extractive sector.,monitoring the customs flow.,strengthening scientific research.,diversification of the energy matrix.,increasing agricultural activity.,2020,85,CH,C,english,"['A', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B']"
QUESTION 86,"The most recent statistics for rural Brazil reveal a paradox that is of interest to society as a whole: agricultural employment is declining in practically every part of the country, but the population living in the countryside is growing again, or at least has stopped falling. These mixed signals suggest that agricultural dynamics, although fundamental, no longer alone determine the direction of rural demographics. This new scenario is partly explained by the increase in non-agricultural employment in the countryside. At the same time, the mass of unemployed, inactive and retired people who live in rural areas has increased. Regarding the Brazilian space, the text presents arguments that reflect the",deregulation of properties in border areas.,inseparability between place of residence and access to income.,correlation between labor force and seasonal migration.,reduced population flow in cities.,heterogeneity of the agrarian way of life.,2020,86,CH,E,english,"['E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']"
QUESTION 87,"In recent decades, there has been a marked feminization of the world of work. While there was little growth in male participation in the post-1970 period, the intensification of women's participation has been the most striking feature.
