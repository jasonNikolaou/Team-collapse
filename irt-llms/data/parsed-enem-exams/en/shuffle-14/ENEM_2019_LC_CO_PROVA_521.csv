QUESTÃO 02,"5 Ways Pets Can Improve Your Health A pet is certainly a great friend. After a difficult day, pet owners quite literally feel the love. In fact, for nearly 25 years, research has shown that living with pets provides certain health benefits. Pets help lower blood pressure and lessen anxiety. They boost our immunity. They can even help you get dates. Allergy Fighters : A growing number of studies have suggested that kids growing up in a home with “ furred animals ” will have less risk of allergies and asthma. Date Magnets : Dogs are great for making love connections. Forget Internet matchmaking — a dog is a natural conversation starter. Dogs for the Aged : Walking a dog or just caring for a pet — for elderly people who are able — can provide exercise and companionship. Good for Mind and Soul : Like any enj oyable activity, playing with a dog can elevate levels of serotonin and dopamine — nerve transmitters that are known to have pleasurable and calming properties. Good for the Heart : Heart attack patients who have pets survive longer than those without, according to several studies.

QUESTÃO 04,"LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Sugar fear-mongering unhelpful By The Washington Times Tuesday, June 25, 2013 In his recent piece “Is obesity a disease?”  (Web, June 19), Dr. Peter Lind refers to high-fructose corn syrup and other “manufactured sugars” as “poison” that will “guarantee storage of fat in the body.”  Current scientific research strongly indicates that obesity results from excessive calorie intake combined with a sedentary lifestyle. The fact is Americans are consuming more total calories now than ever before. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, our total per-capita daily caloric intake increased by 22 percent from 2,076 calories per day in 1970 to 2,534 calories per day in 2010 — an additional 458 calories, only 34 of which come from increased added sugar intake. A vast majority of these calories come from increased fats and flour/ cereals. Surprisingly, the amount of caloric sweeteners (i.e. sugar, high-fructose, corn syrup, honey, etc.). Americans consume has actually decreased over the past decade. We need to continue to study the obesity epidemic to see what more can be done, but demonizing one specific ingredient accomplishes nothing and raises unnecessary fears that get in the way of real solutions.

QUESTÃO 01,"Millennials : Así es la generación que ya no recuerda cómo era el mundo sin Internet Algunos los llaman generación Y, otros “Millennials”, generación del milenio o incluso “Echo Boomers”. Nacieron y crecieron en una era de rápido desarrollo de las nuevas tecnologías, y casi no recuerdan cómo era el mundo sin Internet. Son idealistas, impacientes y están bien preparados académicamente. Muchos de ellos han tenido oportunidad de viajar por el mundo a una edad temprana, de estudiar en las mejores universidades y de trabajar en empresas multinacionales y extranjeras. La generación Y se compone de este tipo de personas que quieren todo a la vez. No están dispuestos a soportar un trabajo poco interesante y rutinario, no quieren dejar las cosas buenas para luego. Lo que sí quieren es dejar su huella en la historia, vivir una vida interesante, formar parte de algo grande, crecer y desarrollarse, cambiar el mundo que les rodea, y no solo ganar dinero.

Ordenadores, teléfonos móviles, GPS, walkmans, televisiones, lavadoras, tostadores, aspiradores y un larguísimo etcétera. Todos usamos aparatos eléctricos que tarde o temprano se convertirán en residuos.  El Hombre Electrónico mide 7 metros de altura y pesa 3,3 toneladas. Es una escultura hecha con la cantidad de residuos eléctricos y electrónicos que un ciudadano medio (en el Reino Unido) tirará a la basura a lo largo de su vida, si se sigue consumiendo este tipo de productos al ritmo actual. El Hombre Electrónico ha sido diseñado por el escultor Paul Bomini con objetivo de aumentar la conciencia de los ciudadanos a la hora de consumir aparatos eléctricos. Esta campaña parte de la base de que todos compramos aparatos electrónicos como herramientas de trabajo u ocio, pero haciéndonos unas cuantas preguntas podemos inducir cambios en nuestro comportamiento que beneficiarán al medio ambiente, otras personas y a nosotros mismos: ¿Tienes algún aparato eléctrico o electrónico que no necesitas? ¿Podrías ser más responsable a la hora de comprar un nuevo producto electrónico? ¿Podrías reciclar o reparar estos productos una vez que se han quedado obsoletos o se han roto? ¿Intentas ahorrar energia en tu vida diaria?

QUESTÃO 04,"Que hay de cierto en la fábula de la cigarra y la hormiga Cuenta una conocida fábula que, tras pasar todo un verano cantando y ociosa, una cigarra se encontró sin alimento y decidió pedir a su vecina, la hormiga algo que llevarse a la boca. Esta le ofreció granos de arroz acompañados de una moraleja: más vale prevenir que lamentar. ¿Merecen su fama de previsoras y afanosas las hormigas? Sin duda. Las hormigas cortadoras de hojas ( Atta cephalotes ), por ejemplo, son consideradas las primeras agricultoras del planeta, dedicadas a cortar, acarrear e integrar hojas en el jardín de hongos del que se alimentan. Otro dato curioso es que se ha comprobado que, prácticamente en todas las especies de hormigas, las más ancianas asumen trabajos de mayor riesgo. De acuerdo con Dawid Moron de la Universidad de Jagiellonian (Polonia), esto se debe a que es mejor para la colonia sacrificar una vida que está cerca de su fin que a un individuo joven. En cuanto a las cigarras, no se les puede acusar de perezosas. Lo que sí es cierto es que los machos pasan el verano “cantando” — un sonido que producen con unas membranas llamadas timbales — y encaramados a un árbol, de cuya savia se alimentan. A fábula é um gênero de ampla divulgação frequentemente revisitado com diversos objetivos.  No texto, a fábula A cigarra e a formiga é retomada para",descrever a relação social entre formigas e cigarras na natureza.,descrever o comportamento dos insetos na natureza.,reforçar o estereótipo associado às cigarras.,apresentar ao leitor um ensinamento moral.,expor a superioridade das formigas em relação às cigarras.,2019,4,LC,B,spanish,"['E', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D']"

QUESTION 06,"Heart cries out for help Naiara Azevedo; Rafael Quadros; Waléria Leão A love like that It was 24 hours side by side A radar on my skin, that hallucinated feeling Heart beating fast Just one look for me to understand It was time to give myself to you Words were no longer needed Ah, just remembering your perfume What a chill, what a shiver My body feels Even if I don't want to, I'll erase you from my mind Ah, this love Has left its mark on my body Ah, this love Just thinking about it, I scream, I almost die These lyrics were composed especially for a campaign to combat violence against women, seeking to raise awareness about the boundaries between loving and abusive relationships. To this end, the strategy employed in the lyrics is to","revealing women's submission to violence, which often leads to their death.",naturalization of oppressive situations that are part of the lives of women living in a patriarchal society.,"exploitation of a double entendre situation, which shows that acts of domination and violence do not constitute love.","emphasis on the need to listen to the pleas of battered women, who continually ask for help.","publicizing the importance of reporting domestic violence, which affects a large number of women in the country.",2019,6,LC,C,english,"['A', 'E', 'C', 'B', 'D']"
QUESTION 07,"Description of poster: Poster with the message: ""Words have power. Words inform, liberate and destroy prejudices. Words misinform, imprison and create prejudice. Freedom of expression. The choice is yours. Responsibility too. Freedom of expression is an unquestionable achievement. What everyone needs to know is that freedom brings responsibility.

QUESTION 08,"Media: allies or enemies of school physical education? In the case of sport, the mediation carried out by the TV camera has created a new form of consumption: TV spectacle sport, a textual reality that is relatively autonomous from the ""real"" practice of sport, constructed by the codification and mediation of sporting events through framing, image editing and commentary, interpreting for the viewer what they are seeing. This phenomenon tends to value form over content, and to this end makes privileged use of audiovisual language with an emphasis on the image, the possibilities of which are being taken further and further as a result of technological advances. On the other hand, sports narration proposes a hegemonic conception of sport: sport is maximum effort, the pursuit of victory, money? The price paid for its spectacularization is the fragmentation of the sporting phenomenon. The overall experience of being an athlete is modified: socializing in confrontation and playfulness are not privileged experiences in the media's focus, but any manifestations of violence, in soccer matches, for example, are shown and re-exhibited all over the world. The reflection brought about by the text, which deals with the spectacle of sport, is based on",equalizing form and content.,viewers' interpretation of the content being broadcast.,use of state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment.,valuing a broader vision of sport.,distortion of the experience of being an athlete for spectators.,2019,8,LC,E,english,"['E', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A']"
QUESTION 09,"A study in red Arthur Conan Doyle My dear Sherlock Holmes, something horrible happened at three in the morning in Lauriston Gardens. Our man on the lookout saw a light at two in the morning coming from an empty house. When he approached, he found the door open and, in the front room, the body of a well-dressed gentleman. The cards in his pocket bore the name of Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. There was no robbery and our man couldn't find anything to indicate how he died. There were no blood marks or wounds on him. We don't know how he got into the empty house. In fact, the whole matter is an endless puzzle. If you can come to the house, that would be great; if not, I'll tell you the details and I'd love to hear from you. Sincerely, Tobias Gregson. Considering the purpose of Tobias Gregson's letter, the sequence of negative statements present in this text has the function of","restrict the investigation, leaving it to the author of the letter.","identify the crime scene, locating it in Jardim Lauriston.","introduce the watchman, including him among the suspects in the murder.","refute possible causes of the gentleman's death, assisting in the investigation.","introduce the recipient of the letter, characterizing their personality.",2019,9,LC,D,english,"['A', 'C', 'E', 'B', 'D']"
QUESTION 10,"A hedgehog If someone from afar tries to get close to it, it closes in (convex integral sphere), erects itself (warlike and multi-spined): and, sphere and thorn, it hedgehogs itself in wait. But not passive (like the hedgehog in the loca); not just defensive (like the cat); but aggressive (like the hedgehog never), the aggressive kind capable of leaping, jumping (not jumping backwards, like the cat): the kind capable of jumping into the assault. If the one from afar comes at her (from afar), from the sphere to the thorns, she is disgusted. She reconverts: the hermetic and armed metal into the flesh of before (concave and favorable), and the feline springs (for the assault) into spiral springs (for the embrace).

QUESTION 14,"The love of single men Victor Heringer The suburbs of Rio de Janeiro were the first thing to appear in the world, even before volcanoes and sperm whales, before Portugal invaded, before Getúlio Vargas ordered the construction of low-income housing. The neighborhood of Queím, where I was born and raised, is one of them. Tucked away between Engenho Novo and Andaraí, it was made of that primordial clay, which came together in various shapes: loose dogs, flies and hills, a train station, almond trees and shacks and townhouses, pubs and war arsenals, haberdasheries and gambling stalls and a huge plot of land reserved for the cemetery. But everything was still empty: there was a lack of people. It didn't take long. The streets gathered so much dust that the man had no choice but to become a man, to sweep them clean. In the evenings, sitting on the balconies of houses and complaining about poverty, talking badly about others and looking at the sidewalks grimy from the sun, the buses on their way home from work dirtying everything up again. By tracing the symbolic genesis of his city, the narrator imbues the text with an aesthetic sense based on",diversity of human types identified by their habits.,eccentricity of the Rio neighborhoods of his childhood.,importance of facts related to the history of the suburbs.,caricature perspective of the landscape with its deteriorated features.,experience of daily life marked by needs and urgencies.,2019,14,LC,D,english,"['D', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'E']"
QUESTION 15,"The web is first and foremost an instrument of communication between people, a virtual link in which communities help their members to learn what they want to know. Data is nothing more than the raw material of a living, highly elaborate intellectual and social process. Finally, all the collective intelligence in the world will never dispense with personal intelligence, the individual effort and time needed to learn, research, evaluate and integrate into different communities, whether virtual or not.

QUESTION 16,"TEXT I Strata In the passage from one language to another, something always remains, even if there is no one to remember it. Because a language retains more memories than its speakers and, like a mineral plate marked by layers of a history older than that of living beings, it inevitably bears the imprint of the ages it has passed through. If ""languages are archives of history"", they lack record books and catalogs. What they contain can only be consulted in part, providing the researcher with less the elements of a biography than a geological study of a sedimentation that took place in a period with no defined beginning or end. TEXT II In the grammatical reflection of the 16th and 17th centuries, Arabic influence appears occasionally, and is mainly a fundamental warlike item in the attribution of coarseness to the Portuguese and Castilian languages by their respective detractors. Resembling Arabic, then, is an accusation of dissimilarity with Latin. Relating the ideas in the texts about the history and memory of languages to the formation of the Portuguese language, it can be seen that",Portuguese is the result of the influence of other languages in the past and bears their marks in its many layers.,the influence of other languages on Portuguese has been uniform throughout history.,the presence of elements from other languages in Portuguese has historically been evaluated as an index of richness.,Arabic and Latin are in the schooling and memory of Brazilian speakers.,the language scholar can accurately identify the elements left by other languages in the transformation of the Portuguese language.,2019,16,LC,A,english,"['C', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'B']"

You know the perpetrator: - Try to convince him/her to change his/her behavior. - If you don't succeed, report the case to the authorities.""

QUESTION 18,"Sport and culture: an analysis of the sportification of bodily practices in indigenous games In the Indigenous Peoples' Games, it can be seen that the bodily practices carried out involve traditional elements (such as paintings and body adornments) and modern ones (such as regulation, inspection and standardization). The bow and arrow and the spear, for example, are instruments traditionally used for hunting and defending the community in the village. At the time of the event, these artifacts were produced by the ethnic group itself, but their structuring as a ""sport"" promoted a similarity between the techniques presented, with the sole purpose of competition. The relationship between traditional and modern elements in the Indigenous Peoples' Games triggered the",individuation of the techniques presented in different modalities.,legitimizing indigenous bodily practices as a sport.,preservation of the specific meanings of bodily practices in each culture.,superimposing traditional elements on modern ones.,standardization of paintings and body adornments.,2019,18,LC,B,english,"['C', 'D', 'E', 'B', 'A']"

In the last comic, a blushing boy has one hand behind his head. It is his hand that is holding the flowers. TEXT II A deaf comic artist is a hit at CCXP with silent narratives The independent artists' area at this year's Comic Con Experience (CCXP) is the largest in the history of the geek event, with more than 450 comic artists and illustrators in Artists ꞌ Alley. And the diversity goes beyond the style of the comics. At one of the tables in row F sits hearing-impaired comic artist Ju Loyola, with her stories that she classifies as ""silent narratives"". These are stories that can be understood by children and adults, and people of any nationality, for the simple reason that they don't contain a single word. The artist doesn't write conventional scripts for her works. Her experience of having to understand communication from what she sees makes her identify much more with what she observes than with what people say. And just by looking at her works, it becomes clear that they are not comics that have lost their words, but have gained a new perspective. Text I exemplifies the work of a deaf artist who promotes an innovative reading experience, as described in Text II.

We want to exalt aggressive movement, feverish insomnia, the running step, the somersault, the slap and the punch. 4) We affirm that the magnificence of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car with its vault adorned with thick, snake-like tubes of explosive breath... a roaring car that seems to run on machine gun fire is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. 5 We want to sing hymns to the man who holds the steering wheel, whose ideal rod crosses the Earth, also launched in a race on the circuit of its orbit. 6. the poet must lavish with ardor, splendor and munificence, to increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.Marinetti's 1909 document proposes the aesthetic references of Futurism, which value the",a return to Hellenism.,static composition.,technological innovation.,suspension of time.,maintaining traditions.,2019,24,LC,C,english,"['D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 25,"A slug's dream Moacyr Scliar She was born a slug, she lived among slugs, but she wasn't satisfied with her condition. We are nothing but despised creatures, she complained. We are only known for our slowness. The trail we leave in history will be as despicable as the goo that marks our passage across the sidewalks. This frustration was matched by a dream: the slug wanted to be like its distant relative, the escargot. The name alone fascinated her: a French term, elegant, sophisticated, a term that people pronounced with respect and even admiration. But, the other slugs reminded her, escargots are eaten, while we at least have a chance of survival. This argument didn't convince the dissatisfied slug, on the contrary: he would much rather end his life this way, at a table with a damask tablecloth, among silver cutlery and crystal goblets. Just as the sea is the only tomb worthy of a batavian admiral,"" she replied, ""the porcelain platter is the only tombstone worthy of my dreams.

QUESTION 26,"The science of Spider-Man Many of the superpowers of the beloved Spider-Man actually resemble the biological abilities of spiders and are the subject of study for the production of new materials. The ""spider-sense"" acquired by Peter Parker functions almost like a sixth sense, a kind of premonitory ability, and therefore sounds like a mere fictional element. However, spiders really do have a heightened sense.  In fact, they have one of nature's most impressive sensory systems. Spiders' sensory hairs, which are scattered all over their bodies, function as a very good way of perceiving the world and picking up information from the environment. In many species, this sense of touch through the hairs plays a more important role than sight itself, since many spiders are able to trap and attack their prey in complete darkness. And why are human hairs not as efficient as spiders' sensory organs? Firstly, because a human being has an average of 60 hairs on every square centimetre of their body, while some species of spider can have up to 40,000 hairs per square centimetre; secondly, because each spider's hair has up to three nerves to communicate between the sensation perceived and the brain, while we humans only have one nerve per hair.",comparison between the superhero's powers and the biological abilities of spiders.,"characterization of the public's affection for the superhero marked by the word ""dear"".",proving the differences between the physical constitution of man and spider using numerical data.,rhetorical question when introducing the causes of the efficiency of the spiders' sensory system.,"revelation of the ""spider-sense"" acquired by the superhero as a sixth sense.",2019,26,LC,D,english,"['C', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'A']"

QUESTION 28,"Losing weight without exercise? Hormone raises hopes of losing fat without leaving the sofa. The solution could come in capsules. The dream of sedentary people has gained a new ally.  A study published in the scientific journal Nature in January suggests that it is possible to modify body fat without exercising. Researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in the USA isolated irisin in the laboratory, a hormone naturally produced by muscle cells during aerobic exercise, such as walking, running or cycling. The substance was applied to rats and acted as if they had been exercising, including having a protective effect against diabetes. The secret was the conversion of white fat - the kind that stores inert energy and spoils our figure - into brown fat. More common in babies and practically non-existent in adults, this type of fat is used to warm us up. In the process, it uses up a tremendous amount of energy. As a side effect, it would thin our silhouette. The hope is that if the hormone works in the same way in humans, a new slimming drug will soon emerge. But it would be far from completely replacing the benefits of physical activity. ""There are possibly many other muscle hormones released during exercise that have not yet been discovered,"" says physiologist Paul Coen, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh in the USA.  Irisin doesn't strengthen muscles, for example.  And to get that tricep of envy, only remote control lifting would not do. To convince the reader that physical exercise is important, the author uses the strategy of saying that",is a way of turning white fat into brown fat and losing weight.,exercise is a way of slimming the figure by eliminating white fat.,"lack of exercise doesn't make you lose weight, it makes you develop diseases.",irisin is a hormone that is only produced through physical exercise.,other hormones are produced and there are other benefits to exercise.,2019,28,LC,E,english,"['B', 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E']"
QUESTION 29,"Songs without meters Winter! winter! winter! Sad fogs, cold blackness of the long boreal darkness, ice fields whose limits always escape us, desperately, beyond the horizon, perpetual inhospitable solitude, where only the voice of the wind can be heard, howling like a legion of wolves, through the city of cathedrals and crystal tombs on the plain, ghosts that populate and animate the mirage, all this: disappointments, darkness, loneliness, despair and the invisible hour that passes like the wind, all this is the cold winter of life.

QUESTION 30,"Before Rome was founded, the hills of Alba were occupied by Latin tribes, who divided the year according to their gods. The Romans adapted this structure. At the beginning of this civilization, the year had ten months and began with Martius (now March). The other two were added by Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome. Until Julius Caesar reformed the local calendar, the months were lunar, but the festivals in honor of the gods remained designated by the seasons. The mismatch of ten days per year meant that a thirteenth month, Intercalaris, had to be added to every triennium. With the help of Egyptian mathematicians borrowed from Cleopatra, Julius Caesar put an end to the mess by establishing the following solar calendar: Januarius, Februarius, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quinctilis, Sextilis, September, October, November and December. Almost the same as ours, except that Quinctilis and Sextilis gave rise to the months of July and August. Considering the information in the text and historical aspects of the formation of the language, the current spelling of the months of the year in Portuguese is",comes from a language spoken in ancient Egypt.,follows the reformulation of the language norm proposed by Julius Caesar.,results from the standardization of the calendar before the foundation of Rome.,reflects the Latin origin of our language.,is based on a calendar created by Cleopatra.,2019,30,LC,D,english,"['B', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'C']"
QUESTION 31,"In Brazil, the spread of an expectation of a body based on the aesthetics of thinness is quite large and has enormous repercussions, especially when considered from the point of view of personal fulfillment. In a survey carried out in the city of São Paulo, 90% of the women surveyed said they were concerned about their body weight, and 95% felt dissatisfied with ""their own body"". Excessive concern with body ""weight"" can lead to the development of disorders directly associated with body image, such as",orthorexia and vigorexia.,anorexia and bulimia.,anxiety and depression.,sedentary lifestyle and obesity.,overweight and social phobia.,2019,31,LC,B,english,"['B', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'D']"

TEXT II Image description : Photographic print by Vick Muniz entitled ""Pictures in Chocolate"". In the image, there is a man with one leg stretched back and his torso leaning forward, making strokes on a large canvas on the floor. He is holding a can of paint in one hand and a paintbrush in the other. The entire image is made up of dark-colored strokes.  Using melted chocolate as a raw material, this work by Vick Muniz reproduces the famous photograph of Jackson Pollock's creative process.

QUESTION 33,"Last week, the students at my son's school mobilized via Twitter not to shop in the school canteen that day, because they thought the price of cheese bread was abusive. They are teenagers. Almost masters of the new technologies, they are on social networks, scanning the world through their mobile keyboards and iPads and organizing themselves to make a peaceful movement not to buy snacks for a day. It was on TV and on many websites. The text addresses the issue of information and communication technologies, specifically the use of social networks. There is much debate about the benefits and harms of using these resources and, in this sense, the text",shows that the demands made on social networks have no impact outside the internet.,addresses the discrimination that social networks suffer from other media.,"looks at social networks as a way of aggregating and empowering groups of people, who come together for their own causes or for social change.","shows that social networks are used inappropriately by teenagers, who, being immature, don't use the tool as a form of social change.",exposes the possibility of social networks favoring violent behavior and manifestations by the adolescents who interact with them.,2019,33,LC,C,english,"['B', 'A', 'D', 'E', 'C']"
QUESTION 34,"""The computer, giving priority to the pursuit of its own happiness, stopped working for humans."" This is how the short story The day a computer wrote a short story ends, written by an artificial intelligence with the help of human scientists. The scientists selected words and phrases that would be used in the narrative, and defined a general script for the story, which would serve as a guide for the artificial intelligence. From there, the computer created the text by combining the phrases and following the guidelines that the scientists imposed. The judges don't know which texts are written by humans and which by computers, which shows that the story was well written. The only reason the day didn't go through to the next stages was because, according to the judges, the characters weren't described very well, although the text was structurally impeccable. The scientists' idea is to continue developing the AI's creativity so that it becomes more and more human-like. Simulating this type of response is difficult, because the computer first needs to have a vast database linked to specific programming for each type of project - writing, painting, music, drawing and so on. The success and limitations of the technology used in the composition of the short story highlight the",indistinction between characters produced by machines and human beings.,the autonomy of computer programs in the development of fiction.,the need to reformulate the database developed by scientists.,difference between the structure and creativity of human language.,artistic quality of texts produced by computers.,2019,34,LC,D,english,"['A', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'E']"

QUESTION 36,"Exposed on the web since pregnancy More than half of the mothers and a third of the fathers interviewed in a survey on paternal sharing on social media discuss their children's upbringing on social networks. Many are first-time mothers and fathers, the fruit of Generation Y (which was born alongside the internet) and use these channels to know that they are not alone in the task of raising a child. There is, however, a risk in the way people are sharing these experiences. It's called parental overexposure, the researchers warn. According to experts on the subject, if you share a photo or video of your young child doing something ridiculous because you think it's funny, when the child is 11 or 12, they may feel embarrassed. Self-awareness comes with age. The display of their children's privacy begins to take on a timeline character and they have no part in approving or refusing the broadcasting of this content. So when the child grows up, their privacy may already have been violated. With regard to excessive parental sharing on social media, the text highlights the following impacts",distancing in the relationship between parents and children caused by the use of social networks.,strengthening of relationship networks as a result of the exchange of experiences between families.,parents' inattention to their children's behavior on the internet.,disrespect for the privacy of children whose images have been posted on social networks.,interference of new technologies in communication between parents and children.,2019,36,LC,D,english,"['C', 'D', 'B', 'E', 'A']"
QUESTION 37,"The DataViva project consists of providing official data on exports, economic activities, locations and professional occupations throughout Brazil. At first, DataViva built a tool that allowed analysis of the Minas Gerais economy based on this complex and diverse methodological perspective. However, given the possibilities offered by the databases it worked with, the platform evolved into a more complete system. In an interactive and didactic way, the user is guided through the various ways of navigating the applications. In addition to information on exported products, as well as the volume of exports in each of the country's states and municipalities, in just a few clicks, the interested party can learn more about the profile of the population, the type of activity carried out, formal occupations and average salaries by category.

QUESTION 38,"Miss Ivan Ângelo The sewing machine moved resolutely across the cloth. What a pretty mother she was, with her pins in her mouth. I liked to watch her quietly, studying her gestures as she cut out scraps of cloth with the scissors. Sometimes she interrupted her work when her mother needed the scissors. She admired her mother's decisive way of cutting cloth; she never hesitated or made a mistake. Her mother knew so much! Tita called her ( ) like she said ( ). She tried not to think the words, but she knew she had thought them at the very moment she tried. Oh, everything was so difficult. Her mother would know what she wanted to ask her intensely now, almost as soon as she was hungry before she died, so much so that she didn't hold back and - Mama, what is ""desquita""? - she said quickly in a voice with no timbre. If someone shouted, the world would end or God would appear - Ana Lucia felt. That moment was very strong, too strong for a little girl, her mother standing still with the scissors in the air, everything unresolved and liable to collapse at any thought, the machine advancing unbridled over the shiny silk dress spreading light light light. Written in the 1960s, the narrative highlights a drama centered on the",association between the girl's anguish and her mother's untimely reaction.,conflicting relationship between domestic work and female emancipation.,expression of existential doubts intensified by the perception of abandonment.,insinuation of the family gap generated by the absence of a father figure.,representation of social stigmas modulated by the child's perspective.,2019,38,LC,E,english,"['B', 'C', 'E', 'A', 'D']"
QUESTION 39,"TEXT I The Statute of the Elderly turned 15 in 2018 and in the first half of the year alone Disque 100 received 16,000 reports of violations of the rights of the elderly across the country. For experts in the field, the increase in the number of complaints may be a consequence of older people being encouraged to seek their rights. But it may also reflect a growing wave of violence in society and within families. More effective public policies to care for the elderly are the minimum a country should establish. Brazil is lagging behind and we need to take into account that the country is getting older (a global trend) without being prepared to take on the challenges, such as creating a protection network, preparing public health services and supporting families who need to look after their dependent elderly.  TEXT II Description of the poster: Poster entitled ""Rights of the elderly"". In the center of the poster, there is a drawing of a white-haired woman with glasses, sitting in an armchair next to a lamp, using a laptop. On the left-hand side of the poster, there is the following text: ""The Statute of the Elderly and the Federal Constitution ensure: Preferential care in the SUS; Priority in the processing of legal proceedings; Preferential parking spaces; Half-price admission to cultural, sporting and leisure events."" On the right-hand side of the poster, there is the following text: ""Low-income elderly people are also guaranteed: Free travel on interstate buses; Assistance of one minimum wage; Access to more than 20 social programs."" When comparing the texts, it can be concluded that the rules of the Statute of the Elderly",contrast with the living conditions offered by the country.,alter the quality of life of people over 60.,have advantages over other countries.,need to be revised because of the ageing population.,are ignored by the families responsible for the elderly.,2019,39,LC,A,english,"['E', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'B']"
QUESTION 40,"Health education through school physical education programs Health education should be achieved through the interaction of actions that can involve man himself through his attitudes towards the environmental demands represented by eating habits, stress, leisure options, physical activity, climatic aggressions, etc. In this way, it seems clear that the state of being healthy is not something static. On the contrary, it is necessary to acquire and build it in an individualized way constantly throughout life, pointing to the fact that health is educable and should therefore be treated not only on the basis of biological and hygienist references, but above all in a didactic-pedagogical context.

QUESTION 42,"What is free software Free software is any computer program built collaboratively, via the Internet, by an international community of independent developers. There are hundreds of thousands of hackers, who deny their association with ""security violators"". These software developers refuse to acknowledge the pejorative meaning of the term and continue to use the word hacker to indicate ""someone who loves to program and who enjoys being skillful and resourceful"". In addition, these programs are delivered to the community with the source code open and available, allowing the original idea to be improved and returned to the community. In conventional programs, the programming code is secret and owned by the company that developed it, making it almost impossible to decipher. What is at stake is the control of technological innovation. Free software is a question of freedom of expression and not just an economic relationship.
